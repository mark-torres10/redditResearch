A while ago I was told that I only voted for liberals because I ""hate"" conservatives.  
  
Now look, I'm not going to try to change your mind, I'm just speaking my own, how *you* feel about conservatives is your own business, but for my part, I don't hate them.  I hate how they vote, but I don't hate *them.*  
  
When I advocate for universal healthcare, it's not universal *with the exclusion of conservatives,* no, it's universal, it's everyone in my country, it's healthcare regardless of race, color, or creed, that simple.  You think I want you to have affordable health insurance because I ""hate"" you?   
  
Liberals, a lot of us, dare I say it, *most* of us, believe that whole ""E pluribus unum"" quite seriously, and few liberals, *if any,* are advocating that progress be made for liberals only.  No, fuck that shit, we're all in this together and we have to have each other's backs, *that's* why I'm a liberal, because the harm done to a human is harm done to humanity.  
  
I don't vote for liberals because I hate conservative, I vote for liberals because I love my country, and I even love those countrymen that I don't like very much.

My ballot isn't determined by anger, or animosity, or hatred, it's determined by *hope.*
