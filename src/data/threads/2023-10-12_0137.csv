2048,confidence,,"Earlier this month, on October 3rd, Representative Kevin McCarthy's term as Speaker of the US House of Representatives came to a close after his fellow Republican Matt Gaetz successfully moved to 'vacate the Chair'.  Gaetz's ability to do this was the result of the [agreement from January](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-of-the-house-ousted-motion-to-vacate-rcna64902) struck between a faction within the far-right House Freedom Caucus, of which Gaetz is a member, and McCarthy's much more numerous supporters in the House Republican Caucus.

Earlier today, in a closed-to-the-public meeting, the House Republican Caucus voted via secret ballot 113 to 99 to nominate Steve Scalise over Jim Jordan to be the next Speaker.  This afternoon the full House is expected to have another vote (or votes) to chose the Speaker, without whom the House can conduct essentially no business.  Some Republican Representatives are indicating that they will not back Scalise for Speaker despite his informal nomination within the caucus; what happens next remains to be seen.  The House Democratic Caucus is expected to remain consolidated behind House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
