As you are no doubt aware, Donald Jonald Trump is on (civil) trial for fraud in the great state of New York.

This is very funny for a number of reasons, and we understand you want to share that in image, GIF, and shitpost form.

We want to support this conversation, but we also don't want the next several hundred posts to be nothing but Trump sitting in court looking sad.

Hence: This megathread.

Feel free to post your art here; there is a significant likelihood that we will be removing posts about it and redirecting the OP here, as well.

As you are no doubt aware, Kevin McCarthy has been removed as Speaker of the House, for the unforgivable crime of...bipartisan legislation to avoid a government shutdown.
