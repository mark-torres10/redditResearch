2048,confidence,,"There seems to be a push from Liberal and Anti-Trump Conservatives to bar Trump from standing for election under section 3 of the 14th Amendment 

'*No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

In addition, he may appeal the convictions which could take years.
