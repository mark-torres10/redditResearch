2048,confidence,,"It's clear that the Republicans are divided into two camps:  The mainstream conservatives, and the performative MAGA members.  Neither of those camps have enough members to successfully nominate a Speaker of the House, making them effectively two parties that operate in coalition with each other.

Will they split entirely?  Tensions between the Conservatives and the MAGA members are high, and the most likely way to get out of this impasse is for one of them to form a coalition with the Democrats, which will almost certainly make their relations worse.  Are we watching a schism open up in the Republican party?  What are the chances this will lead to the MAGA wing breaking from the Conservative wing entirely?

2024 is probably too early for a proper break, however.  Four years from now, when the Conservatives and MAGA have done some more backstabbing and really hate each other, is it possible there will be two different 'conservative' parties in 2028?
