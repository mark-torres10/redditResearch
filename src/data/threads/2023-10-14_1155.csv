2048,confidence,,"From [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/02/08/trump-blasts-nordstrom-tweet-over-daughter-ivanka/97644392/):

> President Trump took to Twitter Wednesday to complain that his daughter Ivanka has been ""treated so unfairly"" by the Nordstrom (JWN) department store chain, which has announced it will no longer carry her fashion line.

Here's the full text of the Tweet in question:

> @realDonaldTrump: My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!

It seems as though President Trump is quite explicitly and actively targeting Nordstrom because of his family's business engagements with the company. This could end up hurting Nordstrom, which could have a subsequent ""chilling"" effect that would discourage other companies from trifling with Trump family businesses. 

* Is this a conflict of interest? If so, how serious is it?

* Is this self dealing? I.e., is Trump's motive enrichment of himself or his family? Or might he have some other motive for doing this?

* Given that Trump made no pretenses about the purpose for his attack on Nordstrom, what does it say about how he envisions the duties of the President? Is the President concerned with conflict of interest or the perception thereof?

* What will be the consequences, and who might bring them about? Could a backlash from this event come in the form of a lawsuit? New legislation? Or simply discontentment among the electorate?",t2_fn25z,False,,0,False,"In a recent Tweet, the President of the United States explicitly targeted a company because it acted against his family's business interests.
