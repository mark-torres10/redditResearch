2048,confidence,,"Here is an e-mail sent to many of us by the Reservation Rats, a group of fullbloods who speak their language fluently and volunteer and live on Indian reservations.


""Almost 20 years ago, grandpa met a little white boy dressed up as an Indian on Halloween. The boy gave a squeal of delight when he spotted grandpa and asked, ""Are you a real Native American??!!!??"" 


""Yes,"" smiled grandpa, a former Medicine Man, ""just like you are one today! But I don't look half as handsome as you do."" 


""Well, what can you teach me about being Indian?"" asked the little boy earnestly. 


""This,"" said grandpa. Then he took his pack of cigarettes from this pocket and threw it in the trash can. ""These are very bad for your health. As an Indian today, you have to always keep your word, so promise me you will never smoke in your life."" 


""I promise!!!"" said the little boy as his parents mouthed thank you to grandpa. 


About 20 years later, I meet this blondie at Yale University who called herself Native American and waved her card at my face to prove it, even though I never asked her to show me any card or to prove her Indian status. The blondie recounted her own experience when she came across a little boy who was dressed up as an Indian on Halloween. She said, ""I went up to him, ripped up the feathers he was wearing. Then I told his mom - *I am Native American and I am NOT a costume! You should be ashamed of yourself for being such a RACIST!!* Then I marched away leaving behind a shocked mother and her equally shocked son who will hopefully never play Indian again. They learned their lesson well!"" 


If the moral of the story isn't already apparent to you, it's this: These elite, highly educated, sophisticated Ivy League white blondes and blondies who are Native American only on paper don't realize that their behavior of screaming racism where there is none, and protesting innocent things like mascots and Halloween, is making the rest of America hate Indians and is portraying us as super-super-sensitive. When we are the exact opposite: Indians are extremely loving, very tolerant, highly accepting and have the most amazing sense of humor.""


There is a saying on reservations that only whiteskins object to redskin because it reminds everyone that these Indians are white.


Mainstream Indians on reservations support mascots and names like Redskins. A UPenn-Annenberg survey shows that 91% of Indians support mascots. Our reasons for supporting mascots are briefly included below

1) When white Indians offend sports fans or insult a little child who
loves Indians and puts on feathers, they alienate the rest of America against brown Indians. Note that the white Indians blend in beautifully into the white society. No one even realizes they are Indian. But when an angered sports fan who is upset about losing his mascot screams “Fuck you sandnigger” or throws a beer can at us from a passing car screaming “MOTHERFUCKER, GO BACK TO YOUR FUCKING RESERVATION!!” they scream such obscenities at my father, my cousin, my brother and my family members who look Indian.


2) The obsession with protesting mascots and names like Redskins is
an obsession of white Indians. They protest mascots, children dressing up on Halloween and other silly things because it makes them feel Indian. It lets them scream racism. They know no other way of feeling Indian. They are totally disconnected from the real issues that affect mainstream Indians on reservations. They are fully Americanized. They have lost their language, culture, religion and even their skin color.


3) Unfortunately the white Indians have the loudest voices. If we go
against them, they hurt us in our careers and lives because they control our media, academia, government jobs, medical clinics, finances, who gets denied federal recognition, even our tribes – everything. They have the money and the power. We have the Indian-ness.


4) Brown Indians on reservations have more important issues to worry
about. Like diabetes, how we get our next meal, crime on reservations, lack of electricity, lack of toilets, lack of running water, no heat when there’s snow outside, getting a relative to a dialysis clinic when there is no transport, finding a job when there’s near 100% unemployment, near 100% consideration of suicide among our youth, alcoholism, drug abuse, elder abuse, spouse abuse, land loss, culture loss, language loss, etc. Mascots are a NON-ISSUE to us.


5) The Indian media should be screaming about the real issues.
Instead their main focus is on mascots. The focus on mascots and meaningless debates about redskins detract attention from the REAL issues facing brown Indians.


6) Indians should do an A-B-C analysis and focus on the A-items.
Mascots and names like redskin, or debates about whether the right word is Native American and not Indian, are not even C items. They are Z items. Unfortunately the white Indians obsess over these Z-items because that is the ONLY way they know how to feel Indian. If we twist America’s arm and get America to concede on the trivial items, the country will lose patience with us when we negotiate important A-items.


7) We are offending our fan base. That little child who insists on
dressing up in a costume and putting on some feathers loves Indians, but when white Indians insult his mom and dad by calling them racists, he grows up to resent those of us who look Indian. Indians were unflappable. Now even a silly word like “costume” that I used above instead of “regalia” raises hackles? Don’t forget, it’s the white Indians who come down and tell the rest of us to be offended.


8) When these white Indians object to mascots, their vocalizations
unite Indian opposition – the opposition finds forums and avenues to kindle hatred against Indians and rehash and reiterate hateful sentiments about Indians. They find a common ground under which those who resent and oppose Indians can unify together and gather in strength.


9) White Indians who oppose mascots point to the Halloween
“blackface” and ask, “Don’t you find that offensive???” And the answer is yes, some Halloween costumes are expressly intended to mock and degrade. Sometimes it is Mother Mary dressed up voluptuously in revealing breasts, sometimes stupid people dress up as a rabbi with a hooked nose eating a bagel and counting money. Sometimes people put on a black face that portrays African Americans with exaggerated noses and large pink lips. Yes, these are no doubt offensive. But mascots usually portray teams that their fans are proud of. The Washington Redskins are proud of their mascots and will surely never run down their mascot this way.


10) The American sports lovers are our brothers and sisters. We love them and respect them and also understand they mean us no disrespect for the most part. Mascots represent their teams and sports fans love their teams. The clueless, identity-less white Indians drive a wedge between the mainstream Indians and sports loving fans causing mainstream America to hate us.


11) **The vocal protests of these clueless white Indians have one more serious consequence: those of us who are poor, brown and Indian-looking cannot sell our Native art. Think about this for a moment. If Blacks made a huge deal about appropriation of African Americans, won't you pause for a moment before you buy a t-shirt with a black theme? These days because of all these protests over mascots and Halloween, Americans have become so sensitive about offending Natives that they are afraid of wearing Native jewelry and buying Native art pieces. Because they don't want to offend Natives who protest redskins and other forms or “appropriations”. Which is really hurting Native artisans who make such jewelry and Native art.**


12) In the same vein, it is only the white Indians who obsess about identity politics and play Identity Police. On Indian reservations, we have a standing joke:


Q: What do you call a nation full of white people?


A: The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. 


The all-white Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma is the leading identity police. They have also been whites for quite a few generations now! Why is it that only the white Indians obsess about identity politics and play Identity Police? This is because such Indians are mistaken for Caucasian throughout the world. One way they can reiterate their sense of identity is by pointing out that ""he is not Indian"" or ""she is not Indian"" or ""they are wannabes."" Indians have been through a holocaust and accusing someone of not being Indian is a very serious charge and something to be frowned upon, as is discriminating against Indians from tribes that have no federal recognition (the PC term is unrepresented tribes). What is noteworthy is that it is always the white Indians who play identity cops. Look at anyone who is accusing someone of not being Indian. With the possible exception of XXXX XXXXX (an identity cop who is African American with Indian status), almost all the other identity police are WHITE themselves. Such whites with Indian status get their sense of identity by accusing others of not being Indian.
