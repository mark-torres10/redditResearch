2048,confidence,,"US Representative Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) has withdrawn his candidacy to be Speaker of the House of Representatives due to his inability to muster the necessary support to win a full floor vote. He was nominated by the House Republican Caucus to be the Republicans’ choice for Speaker over Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) earlier this week in a secret vote of 113 to 99. Withholding their votes from Scalise is a faction of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, [per the Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-ousted-speaker-jordan-scalise-1492ca6b58604c51186015c23f7efccd|https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-ousted-speaker-jordan-scalise-1492ca6b58604c51186015c23f7efccd>). Scalise has said he will stay on as House Majority Leader. It is unclear who the GOP will next nominate as their candidate for Speaker. Without a Speaker, the House is unable to conduct virtually any business.
