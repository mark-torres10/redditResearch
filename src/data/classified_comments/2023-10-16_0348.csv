k29ofz8,CanuckPanda,ism7i,"This is a well-documented reason for the collapse of the Russian empire and the overthrow of the Tsar. 

See, Nicky II and the Imperial Ministry were in what Mike Duncan has described as a “hermetically sealed imperial bubble”. The ministry and the tsar were surrounded by similarly sheltered nobility and their handlers. Their handlers, in protecting their livelihood, would tell the ministry and the tsar what they wanted to hear over the truth. “Yes Tsar, everyone loves you,” “yes Tsar, the unrest in the streets is just a tiny group of socialists and Jews”, “yes tsar, you’re right to get us involved in a war in Serbia” and so forth. 

They *legitimately and honestly* believed in what you may define today as “alternative facts”. More importantly, they had run out every voice of honesty around them, so that everyone believed that same thing. 

They were truly unprepared for the revolutions in Russia and for the state of the Russian armed forces. Right up until Nicky and family got bullets in their brain, they were *positive* that “real Russians” were the majority and would save them. This in spite of the mass peasant uprisings in the rural regions, soldiers and workers Soviets springing up and replacing the failed state, et al. 

Sheltered carriages have been replaced by private jets, palaces by boardrooms, mineral wealth by stock investments. But the same ignorance of the ruling class exists today in the same extreme.

It’s government of the people to provide for their own people. Gaza has received aid not mention infrastructure left by Israel when they moved out of Gaza. It’s not Israel’s responsibility to provide resources to a state that is governed by people whose founding belief is annihilating them. Gaza did not have a blockade until Hamas was elected and took power of the region. All they had to do was recognize Israel, stop the violence, and commit to previous agreements. If Hamas does not want to do that or provide for their own people, it’s not Israel’s fault it doesn’t happen.

It also doesn’t matter that not every Palestinian is a terrorist. Their government is run by terrorists, and they have relentlessly attacked Israel since they were elected and took power.

k4enbws,BlueToadDude,ez86ao763,"As of yesterday, Israel was still using roof-knocks and sms/call tactics to give civilians a chance to get away from Hamas's targets. Even after everything that happened. But no doubt these would have to stop at some point in order to actually hit terrorists with them running away. It is a real tragedy for sure.

Here is some context to what happened from the Israeli perspective that I collected and are trying to share for those who are interested:

The death toll now confirmed to be over 1,200. Most of the deaths are unarmed civilians. Many elderly, women, children. There are many more not accounted for.

In some towns the terrorists moved house to house murdering whole families. When they could not get into houses they burned them down, waiting for the residents outside. 

Elderly corpses lying on bus stations face down, some were kidnapped, along with mothers and their babies. Roads filled with cars sprayed down, whole families dead inside. And much more. The horror doesn't end with Hamas.

There are horrible things such as footage of a family where the terrorists have [murdered](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/172x3tj/israeli_mother_covers_the_head_of_her_child_on/) one of the 3 kids in front of the rest of the family and kidnapped the survivors. Endless more similarly horrifying stories.

Parents are still identifying the bodies of their children from videos Hamas took stomping on their corpses. People are [learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/174jys0/imagine_learning_your_relative_died_like_this/) how their relatives died from Hamas uploading pictures and videos of their corpses to their Facebook page.

Hamas is [parading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172hscy/shani_louk_30_yearold_german_citizen_she_went_to/) the corpses of innocent half naked women through the streets. To be spat on by the crazed mob.

There are estimations of some 40+ dead babies [killed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/174ouk4/an_israeli_childs_blood_stained_crib_discovered/) mostly in point blank range. This is only from a single town where the police and military could go house to house and check for corpses already.

Reporters have finally made it into towns and are [describing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/174lgzl/reporting_on_hamass_atrocities_whole_families/) horrible atrocities and non stop finding of bodies in homes.

Yet celebrations are happening all over the world. Both in Palestinian territories like in [Nablus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172ks18/massive_party_today_in_nablus_celebrating_the/) and [Hebron](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172lh9y/palestinian_celebrations_in_hebron_from_earlier/) but also in [Sweden](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/1738nsp/death_toll_over_750_israelis_mostly_innocent/), [Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/17316rq/propalestinians_celebrating_hamass_massacres_of/), [London](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172u5gu/celebrations_in_london_tonight/), and many [states](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/1737cfp/while_death_toll_in_israel_climbs_to_over_700/) around the US.

Not enough evidence gets out. Social media censors it together with mass reports by Hamas sympathizers and a lot of disinformation denying the horrible crimes. We have the evidence, we can't post them anywhere without posts removed or accounts banned. I have some materials if anyone wants to DM me and see Hamas's true face.

When Turkish towns were overrun with PKK militants that claimed self rule after peace process failed in 2015, who also did numerous suicide bombing attacks in city centers at the same time, Turkey didn’t do any “carpet bombing”.

For 8 grueling months with curfews and humanitarian corridors being opened every week Turkish security forces killed more than 2000 militants and apprehended just as many. In 8 months in 7 different cities 130 civilians lost their lives. Israel did that in one afternoon. If Israel was in our shoes tens of thousands would die by this metric. In those 8 months almost 1000 security personnel lost their lives so that we wouldn’t do “carpet bombing”. Heroes, every single one of them.

Most people don't actually bother looking into what US military was doing but they were attempting to create a stable nation state in Afghanistan just like they did in South Korea. Only difference is Afghani and Korean culture is widely different and Americans found it the hard way. They eventually ditched.

Of course they bare responsibility for their actions but the government and schools were clearly bad actors as well in these transactions. 

I agree we need to get the government out of the loan business but I don't think we can just cut off the schools and students cold turkey. My suggestion for a fix would be to force government public schools to offer a instruction cost only tuition option. So people that want the current system going to a state school can keep doing as they do today. But people that want to pay a lower amount would be offered a tuition based on the direct costs of instruction,  eg professors wages. As most public schools have paid off their buildings or had them covered by other state funds the actual direct cost of an undergrad on tuition only is not much. Then all other amenities such as football tickets, gym, clubs, the lazy river would not be part of that tuition plan, the schools could offer those on a fee for use option if they choose to or just not offer them at all. That would allow the schools to get back to a education first model and no longer force poor kids that don't have time for the country club life style as they need to study coming from bad high schools to not take on debt so rich kids can have a country club experience.

Semantics.

If the Fed is only the facilitator, then the legislative/executive branch should have the power to eliminate the Fed. However, this is practically impossible, since the government could not function without a central bank. Therefore, the Fed has power over all 3 branches of government, and not the opposite.

Nor is wealth hoarded. it does one or more of 3 things, as it does

1- The rich will place their wealth in the banks which is then loaned out by the banks which in turn creates new jobs

2- The wealthy will invest their wealth in some other industry through stocks/equities which again will create new jobs

3- The wealthy will spend their wealth on their own consumption which in turn also creates new jobs

That's is the trickle down theory and it works fine

**THE PROBLEM THE LEFT [ like the OP ] WHINES ABOUT BUT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND**, is that government has inserted itself because it thinks it knows better then the market where wealth should flow.

Through policies of theft ( taxation ), prohibition, state granted monopolies, subsidies, and regulations, it has stifled the flow of wealth and thus the poor suffer for it

Between 2012 and 2018, Netanyahu gave Qatar approval to transfer a cumulative sum of about a billion dollars to Gaza, at least half of which reached Hamas, including its military wing. According to the Jerusalem Post, in a private meeting with members of his Likud party on March 11, 2019, Netanyahu explained the reckless step as follows: The money transfer is part of the strategy to divide the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Anyone who opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the transfer of the money from Qatar to Hamas. In that way, we will foil the establishment of a Palestinian state (as reported in former cabinet member Haim Ramon’s Hebrew-language book “Neged Haruach”, p. 417).”

that is a very common diversion tactic, but the reality is that it's not about that. Palestinians get their homes taken away from them.

They're literally doing it now. Kicking people out of their own homes.

The three religions come from there. At one point, it was one religion. They are all natives there except the Europeans of course. Those are from Europe.

On the Taiwan issue, both Washington and Beijing have mostly pursued a policy of deterrence and escalation, engaging in a confrontational action-reaction cycle of hostile deterrence and resolve while showing minimal willingness to engage in credible policies of reassurance. This confrontational interactive dynamic feeds animosity and distrust between Washington and Beijing regarding each other’s intentions toward Taiwan. 

In order to reestablish a credible level of mutual reassurance Washington and Beijing should adopt the following policies:

• Washington should unambiguously reaffirm the original elements of its One China policy and place clear limits on the level and type of contact between American and Taiwanese military and civilian officials. Beijing should unambiguously reaffirm its commitment to uncoerced, peaceful unification as a top priority.

• Washington should state clearly that the United States does not regard Taiwan as a critical strategic node in its overall regional defense posture and remains open to any peaceful, uncoerced resolution of Taiwan’s status. Beijing should also state clearly that it does not view control over Taiwan as essential to its military defense.

• Beijing should declare that it will significantly reduce military forays and exercises within the Taiwan Strait provided that Washington reduces its own extensive military activities along China’s maritime coast.

• Washington should reconsider its prohibition under the Six Assurances against discussions with Beijing regarding military sales, activities, and deployments relevant to Taiwan. What, if any, types of reciprocal restraints might be possible regarding the military capabilities and actions of either side should be raised, at least initially, in Track Two or Track 1.5 dialogues. 

• Washington should convey its strong support for cross-Strait talks without preconditions and strongly urge both Taipei and Beijing to adjust their stances to make the possibility of talks more likely.

Weifeng Zhong and Christine McDaniel point out in an op-ed regarding barriers to restoring chip manufacturing:

> [Any resulting new operations would still face deep-rooted issues hindering American manufacturing. Large-scale environmental assessments will be required, but over the years, the costs and delays have become excessive. Recent trends promoting or requiring unionized workers for federal contracts, combined with the current labor shortage, will hinder chipmakers' ability to find talent and could exacerbate the cost of domestic production.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/chips-act-distracts-from-bigger-china-challenge)

From the years that I’ve been around, I just recognize that there is a consistent pattern in our news cycles. Each of our new cycles seems to carefully hinge on the recurring theme of threat. Left-wing media portrayed Donald Trump as a consistent threat to our democracy throughout his entire presidency, and the right wing media portrayed Barack Obama as a existential threat to our democracy throughout his presidency. This theme of threat was just enough to keep most people aroused and engaged with the media cycle. It’s also just convenient that we, as a society, tend to enjoy engaging and debating over these issues, so a lot of people make politics and media cycles a component of their day. Think about how much we could do to improve things if we liberated ourselves from the grasp of our media cycles.

I stay engaged, but I do my best to remain aware, and to recognize these prevailing patterns in politics. To me, both parties are the same: one party tends to favor initiatives that will benefit the wealthy, the other tends to favor initiatives that give government a more active role in the lives of every day Americans, but they both tend to skew towards fascism in their own way.

Initially, no.  It may even take generations because a massive correction is now required.  Pain and sacrifice across the board.  We're back to planting a seed because the first tree of liberty has been cut down to build false senses of security and comfort.  You may think that society is putty that can be molded and shaped from the top down by a ruling body, but it's not how prosperity is created.  That's oppressive, not prosperous.  Prosperity isn't some diagram flow.  It's just created at the bottom and there's no direction to it.

And yet, 7 year olds aren't running around in public with knives when it's perfectly legal (I think).

We don't need legal repercussions to prevent the action from recurring. 7 year olds shouldn't be driving, and your argument that a parent would let them I disagree with. And if the parent did let them, then it's on the parent to be responsible for them when something goes wrong.

Blind people have the capacity to recognize they shouldn't be driving. They don't need laws to know this. Along with this, mentally disabled people as well. How would they even get cars? Only from someone responsible for them, or responsible enough to (hopefully) realize they shouldn't be selling cars to blind and mentally disabled people.

Okay, sure, shady car salesman sells to anyone. What happens then? The same thing that happens to anyone who drives a vehicle, nothing, until something bad happens, and then we determine who is at fault.

If denying / suspending / revoking the license of someone who has multiple moving violations (which includes driving without a license, drunk driving, speeding, failure to stop, yadda,) is ineffective at getting them off the road, how is making you carry a special card / license going to make it better? Not having a license should be a ""Go directly to jail; do not pass go, do not collect $200"" situation but otherwise jailing crappy drivers seems pointlessly punitive. The insurance company already knows, by the way, about *all* the tickets you receive and will jack your rates accordingly.

I’ll wear my N95. 

In June, members of the CDC’s group — the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee — presented a draft of their report, citing studies that found no difference in infection rates among health providers who wore N95 masks versus surgical masks in the clinic. They noted flaws in the data. For example, many health workers who got Covid in the trials were not infected while wearing their masks at work. But still, they concluded the masks were equivalent….(bad data gathering)….

Their conclusion runs contrary to the CDC’s 2022 report, which found that an N95 mask cuts the odds of testing positive for the coronavirus by 83%, compared with 66% for surgical masks and 56% for cloth masks. It also excludes a large clinical trial published in 2017 finding that N95 masks were far superior to surgical masks in protecting health workers from influenza infections. And it contradicts an extensive evaluation by the Royal Society, the United Kingdom’s national academy of sciences, finding that N95 masks, also called N95 respirators, were more effective against Covid than surgical masks in health care settings around the world.

But they have a legitimate point in saying that simply giving up their own territory (and people) to the Russian government in exchange for Russia's word, isn't exactly a strong case. They denuclearized in 1994 under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, in exchange for security guarantees from Russia. Then, twenty years later, in 2014 Crimea was attacked and occupied by Russia followed by the full scale invasion last year. Ukraine isn't alone, Moldova had Transinistra tanken by Russia in 1992 and Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia were taken in 2008. Senseless bloodshed is what Russia does.

-The ""crisis"" and ""the atrocity"" that this man **standing in front of an Israeli flag** says the US is ""responding to"" is the ""crisis"" of Palestinians trying to resist genocide.

-""Countries or groups trying to take advantage of this atrocity"" here means countries that try to attack Israel, to **try to help Palestinians**, like Lebanon is starting to do via Hezbollah and Iran is (very mildly) threatening to do if the massacre doesn't stop. No other countries actually did or said they'd do anything to help stop this genocide (there was a story going around that the Emir of Qatar threatened to cut supply of LNG to the world if the massacre doesn't stop, but it doesn't seem real as far as I can tell).

-What do you think ""deplyoing more assets"" means? They already give munitions, weapons, fighter jets and sent in an aircraft carrier... It can only mean send in troops...

-""We aren't going anywhere"", so, yes, the US makes it clear it will continue to support the genocide of Palestinians.

>   “Israeli border policewoman arrested on suspicion of shooting Palestinian for fun.” Subhead: “Judge says suspect shot the man, who was seriously wounded, ‘as a dubious form of entertainment.’ ” (October 15, 2018)


>   “Israeli army denied soldiers threw gas canister into a Hebron school. Then a video surfaced.” Subhead: “After the video surfaced, the IDF altered its response,” saying that the soldiers did throw grenades, because the students threw stones at them. (December 6, 2018)


>   “Israel said a Palestinian was killed in clashes. A video shows he was shot in the back.” Subhead: “While the army says Mohammad Khossam Khabali was shot during violent clashes, video shows him walking with friends on the main street.” (December 9, 2018)


> “Deterrence? Israel demolishes Palestinian assailant’s home — for the third time.” (December 16, 2018)


> “The disabled Palestinian slowly walked away. Then Israeli troops shot him in the back of the head.” Security cameras showed they were 80 meters away. (December 17, 2018)


> “After shooting a Palestinian teen, Israeli troops dragged him around — and chased an ambulance away.” Subhead: “The Palestinian from the Jalazun refugee camp died after soldiers kept him from receiving medical care.” (December 20, 2018)


> “Palestinians recall settlers dressed in white firing at them, as soldiers stood by.” (January 28, 2019)


> “[Five Israeli Soldiers] beat a detained Palestinian and made his son watch.” (January 31, 2019)


> “Without saying a word, Israeli troops beat up a blind man in his bed.” Subhead: “Israeli soldiers invaded the home of a Palestinian family at night, and battered a man in the face in front of his wife and children. He is 47, blind and on dialysis, and his toes have been amputated because of diabetes.” The soldiers only stopped beating the man when they realized that he couldn’t be the suspect they were after. No legal action was taken against them. (February 28, 2019)


> “Israel forces Palestinian to raze his and his daughter’s homes with his own hands.” Subhead: “In East Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities require residents to demolish their ‘illegally built’ homes by themselves or to pay the city exorbitant sums for doing it.” (March 7, 2019)


> “How the Israeli army shot dead a Palestinian paramedic in a refugee camp.” Subhead: “Sajed Mizher, a volunteer paramedic…walked over to a man wounded by a gunshot [and] was shot himself.” (April 5, 2019)",/r/socialism/comments/178c09i/not_sure_if_this_belongs_here_but_these_are/k4z7ni6/,1697378881.0,r/socialism,0.5300296,1,True,2023-10-16_0348

k4zf8fz,RobotPirateMoses,ceoel,"Since we're documenting Israeli atrocities, might as well add some more here:

-Remember the nonsense about ""Hamas decapitating babies"" that the reporter admitted was based on nothing? Well, [here's an eyewitness report (ie she saw them herself) by a reporter that Israel beheaded 10 babies](https://x.com/zei_squirrel/status/1713297978193064273?s=20). Still not convinced? Yeah, I understand, it's an outrageous claim, but (**NSFL WARNING**, ofc) [here's a video (not just an easily-faked image) of a toddler beheaded by Israel](https://x.com/zei_squirrel/status/1713300764758512102?s=20).

-Again, massive **NFSL WARNING**, cause [here's a video of Israelis quite literally urinating on Palestinian corpses](https://x.com/timand2037/status/1713460018400436474?s=20). Not even in **death** are Palestinians allowed dignity.

-And here's a reminder that [the IDF itself just regularly posts videos of them committing war crimes, **because they're proud of it**](https://x.com/AlanRMacLeod/status/1712964432723136603?s=20).

And here's just some more awful stuff in general:

-[Here's an Israeli woman on TikTok celebrating the fact Palestinian are being bombed ""day and night, every few minutes"" and so close to her that she can hear the bombs and ""Hamas being pulverized""](https://x.com/mariyyum/status/1713302734450115019?s=20) and thanking the IDF for it. She says ""if you touch a single hair on any Jews' head we will obliterate you from the face of the Earth... Hamas is such pure evil"".

-And, for some history since a lot of people don't know it, here's a [video where a man lists just **some** of the massacres committed by Israel over the years that most so-called humanitarians around the world ignored](https://x.com/Shuounislamiya/status/1713335059976237165?s=20).

-And [here's the most current death toll I can find](https://x.com/GenerousAdvice/status/1713553249482006829?s=20):

>Palestinian Ministry of Health is reporting that Israel has killed 2329 Palestinians as of 7:45 this morning including 55 ENTIRE FAMILIES.

Btw ""55 families"" here doesn't just mean ""mom, dad and children"". ""Families"" here **refers to the entire family tree, from grandchildren all the way up to grandparents, with nephews/nieces and uncles/aunts included**,

So many people were cheering or putting their heads in the sand while mass atrocities occurred. If you're curious as to how Bush sailed into a second term as President, this is how.

k50jn7p,Necessary_Effect_894,bkkb7p20,"That polls can be untrue. Or it could be true but the speech used to present it could be manipulative. A poll from Fox News could contain lies that could “poison the well”

As Marxists, we can’t use that information. It’s, plainly put, non scientific.

I don’t know how good you’re at statistics but I’m pretty good at it, and I can tell you, this information here is merely propaganda.

If Fox News reports that “most Americans are pro Israel! Are you with us, or against us? Most of us chose Israel, and you wouldn’t wanna be the weird one out”, then readers might be influenced by this information in a non scientific way. This isn’t what we stand for, since we care about dialectical materialism.

Look at the headline of the article:

“Voters overwhelmingly side with Israel…”

Then it says “7 out of 10 voters side with Israelis”?

Most people won’t read beyond that. 

What voters? How did they perform the survey?  What question did they ask? Can you ascertain that the people who did the study don’t have a bias or bested interest in it? Sample size? Sample control? 

“Conducted October 7-9, 2023, under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 716 registered voters nationwide who were randomly selected from a voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all registered voters.”

716 Americans… “most Americans.” This is not good enough to make that headline. And how can you trust that’s true? Mate, people in science cherry pick so often nowadays most statistics are completely useless.

How can you scientifically trust this information? Your average reader won’t think any of this, they’ll think “oh so most people side with Israel then”

Is this true? Can you answer right this very instant that that statement is true?

Obviously not. Neither can Fox. I don’t care if they’ve been reputable as the OP says, I work in science and I can tell you that Ph.D holders are some of the shadiest people around when there’s an agenda in place. Can you ascertain that the people who made this poll are the people who care about the truth? And if so, where’s the study itself?

Far from. But Antisemitism can be found on almost every level of British society. As a transplanted New Yorker, I'm often startled by what can pass in casual conversation (from “of course he's cheap, he's Jewish” to “Hitler should have killed them all.”). Surveys show that antisemitic attitudes are more common among supporters of the ruling Conservative party than Labour supporters. But the latter are in no sense immune.""

So of course antisemitism exists on the left, just like antisemitism and racism and unchallenged prejudices exist everywhere!

k51s49n,don_detrillo,1zl26c,"Marx published an essay, [""On The Jewish Question""](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/) that includes some pretty old tropes around “huckstering”. Walter Kaufmann, a preeminent Jewish and German-American philosopher, discusses the essay in his book Without Guilt and Justice, and It’s also more flagrantly anti-Semitic in the original German.

[Here's a link to the excerpt on Marx's essay](https://online.fliphtml5.com/pthhn/imtb/#p=1), and a brief snippet that I’ve highlighted below:


What the reader of the English is thus led to miss is the distressing fact that some of Marx’s paragraphs do bring to mind the Nazis’ leading anti-Semitic journal, Der Sturmer. But it is not only the language that oozes hatred and contempt; Marx calls “Jewish” all that is most hateful to him in the modern world. (I have rendered Schacher by jewing, which the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary calls colloquial and links with sense 2 of Jew: ‘Applied to a grasping or extortionate usurer, or a trader who drives a hard bargain or deals craftily.”)

- Let us not seek for the secret of the Jew in his religion; let us rather seek for the secret of his religion in the actual Jew.
- What is the secular foundation of Judaism? Practical urges, selfishness. — What is the Jew’s secular cult? Jewing. What is his secular god? Money. Well then! Emancipation from jewing and from money would be the self-emancipation of our age.
- An organization of society that would eliminate the presuppositions of jewing and thus the possibility of jewing, would have made the Jew impossible.

This, says Marx, would be a triumph over “the highest practical expression of human self-alienation.”

Nothing in his budding view of history compelled Marx to write like that. After all, this is a travesty of Judaism, and insofar as the Jews were pushed into certain ways of making a living, it was Christian society that had forbidden them to own land, bear arms, or study at the universities. But Marx was so determined at that point to blame all misfortunes on the Jews that he expatiated at some length on the theme that “The Jews have become emancipated insofar as the Christians have become Jews.” Insofar as Christians are venal, selfish, and money-hungry, they have become Jews! And “that the proclamation of the gospel itself, that the Christian ministry has become a commercial object” proves “the practical dominion of Judaism over the Christian world.”

I am a socialist with values rooted in solidarity and a worldview informed by historical materialism, and I think that it is ridiculous to use these statements from Marx to invalidate the socialist project or to in any way to equate the presence of antisemitism on the Left or in the USSR with the Nazi holocaust. But, as you said OP, two things can be true at once. It doesn’t do us any favors to dismiss all accusations of antisemitism as pernicious forms of imperialist or Zionist propaganda. We should examine them, take them seriously when seriousness is called for, and learn from them so we can build a more inclusive, powerful, and successful Left.

As the most widely maligned Middleman Minority throughout history, Jews have had to be beyond reproach to be safe in this world. Ironically, Israel’s apartheid government makes Jews in the world *less safe* because it hands people everywhere the material to practice the age-old tradition of blaming Jews. Also worth noting that anti-semitic hate crimes have risen stratospherically since Trump’s 2016 win.

The past days have had a seismic effect on Jews worldwide. The violence in Israel and Gaza leave us all feeling shattered. We fear for the lives of our families and friends; we fear for the lives of Israelis and Palestinians.
For Jews of the Left, another challenge presents itself. Here there are feelings of loneliness, horror, and political paralysis, not only at the violence but at the callous and cruel responses of people we once considered friends and political allies. All this as a wave of antisemitism threatens Jews in the diaspora. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that these events will fundamentally alter our political position for decades to come.
In some ways this is unprecedented. But it is also extremely familiar. What is new? Only the collective feeling of panic. Many Jews faced similar panics – but never so globally, not in recent memory. Up to this point, the creeping realization of our Jewish alienation has been an isolating experience by its very nature. Momentarily, we have a different possibility: collective education, political reformation. I certainly prefer it to endless news consumption.
We are not alone in this work. We never have been. An important body of knowledge analyzes the unique position of the Jew of the Left and presents an unflinching critique of antisemitism.
My title references a term coined by Shaul Magid. Much as a certain strain of critical race theory treats racism as a constitutive element of American society, scholars sometimes treat antisemitism as an inescapable fact of the world in which we live. Magid is ambivalent about this frame, but he admits that sometimes “a problem can best be understood, not by positing ways to solve it, but through assessing its contours, its origins, and its reach.” It is with this frame in mind that we call these works Judeo-Pessimist. One could equally speak of a critical theory of antisemitism.
Most of the work presented here is easily accessible online. It includes academic articles, journalistic work, and blog posts, with a particular focus on post-Holocaust antisemitism. The frames range from liberal to Marxist to anarchist, some Zionist, some not. I recommend going through sequentially, although some may find it more appealing to browse the early articles of each section before digging in to the heavier content.
“The Jew-of-the-Left”: An introduction to Albert Memmi
Why, as Jews, do we hold the politics we do? How can one exist on the Left and remain a Jew? How can one exist as a Jew and remain on the Left?
The single most significant thinker in this collection is Albert Memmi. The Tunisian-French philosopher is best known for his work The Colonizer and the Colonized (1957). He was also an engaged critic of antisemitism. After his emigration to France, he was shaken by the persistence of French antisemitism and by the ignorance and callousness of the French Left. Unfortunately, most of Memmi’s work is not so easily accessible online. Both The Portrait of the Jew and The Liberation of the Jew are absolutely essential reads – reach out to me for help finding a digital copy. For now, these introductions from David Schraub help to anchor our discussion moving forward. Schraub also appears throughout the pamphlet.

The Debate Link: Memmi on the ""Mistaken"" Belief of Jewish Suffering (dsadevil.blogspot.com)
Schraub is one of the sharpest contemporary analysts of antisemitism. He expands further on some essential ideas in the following texts.

For a more comprehensive discussion of the Left’s “Jewish problem,” I also recommend the article “Looking Left at Antisemitism” by Spencer Sunshine.
Looking Left at Antisemitism – Spencer Sunshine (transformativestudies.org)
The Left critique of anti-Zionism
The following talk by British sociologist and Marx scholar Robert Fine provides a critical introduction to Holocaust memory, antisemitism after the Holocaust, and the role of Israel. He critiques an anti-Zionism that condemns Israel as a unique evil. A well-known saying calls antisemitism “the socialism of fools”; Fine critiques this anti-Zionism as an “anti-nationalism of fools.”

Steve Cohen provides a more confrontational and anarchistic perspective on a similar topic. “As an opponent of Israel I will not exceptionalise Israel. And as an opponent of Zionism I do not, will not, demonise Zionism.”
Writing as a Jewish traitor - Steve Cohen | libcom.org
I also highly recommend Cohen’s book That’s Funny, You Don’t Look Antisemitic.
This 1982 text from preeminent left Jewish editors, published in the American-Jewish leftist journal Jewish Currents, expresses the (now often forgotten) desperation and disillusionment of Jews on the Left, faced with the transparent antisemitism of Soviet anti-Zionism. They denounced the Soviet Union’s decades-long suppression of Jewish life and culture as a “historic act of destroying a people by tearing up its culture by the roots” and a “rape” of “the most elementary principles of humanism and socialism.”
The Soviet Jewish Situation: A Declaration – Paul Novick, Chaim Suller, Itche Goldberg, Morris U. Schnappes – Jewish Currents (1982) 
Next is an essential, if dense, article by Schraub that analyzes Black Republicans and Jewish anti-Zionists as a unique political phenomenon of the dissident minority: a group within a minority that dissents on a political question considered by most of that minority group to be of existential importance. The question, for Schraub, is not about the abstract validity of Jewish anti-Zionism (or Black conservatism) but the objective role these groups play in antisemitic and racist societies.
Pulling from thinkers like Hannah Arendt and critical race theorist Derrick Bell, Schraub draws out the basic contradiction: groups that exclude Jews for holding politics representative of Jewish opinion on Israel and antisemitism will, simultaneously, prop up the “dissenting minority” because they are Jews. This perversion of identity politics provides a Jewish alibi for an antisemitic environment. “Me, antisemitic? Some of my best friends are Jews; and they happen to agree with me!”",/r/socialism/comments/178i10q/why_do_i_keep_reading_that_the_left_traditionally/k50as2u/,1697394061.0,r/socialism,0.4232316,0,True,2023-10-16_0348

At what point, can we still call this self-defense?

I want peace for everyone, Israelis and Palestinians but the hypocrisy of these politicians amazes me. They don't see Palestinians as human at all.

I really hope after this war is over, the ICC will look at Israel's response and convict them for war crimes otherwise it would be hard to take them seriously in future when it seems Israel has been given the exception to act however they want.
