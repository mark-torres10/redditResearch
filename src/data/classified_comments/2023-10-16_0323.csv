If the choice is between someone who has worked with democrats in the past, seems to genuinely care about democracy and the republic, who can go through the motions of making sure the government doesn’t shut down, ensure aid is distributed fairly and where it needs to go, and what we currently have, she would be a significant step forward. 

Jeffries has almost no chance to be the speaker. It just isn’t going to happen. 

And remember that just because you’re the speaker doesn’t mean that you can pass anything you want. McCarthy was a perfect example of that. 

If Cheney was speaker, she would effectively be a democrat speaker, that would likely be willing to compromise to some degree to the point where things would function as close to the norm as realistically possible. No significant legislation, either conservative or progressive, would pass, with any spending bills / housekeeping bills being passed with almost entirely democrat support with the few republicans who voted for her in the first place. 

Her goal would be to keep the government functioning somewhat, and likely just keeping everything the same with no significant spending cuts or increases, and wait until next years election to allow the house to hopefully correct itself. 

She wouldn’t be able to go rogue either because democrats could just vote her out. And you know that republicans wouldn’t save her.

What the fuck kind of history books are you reading?!  You need better ones.  Regardless of whatever publicly expressed goals of Reconstruction may have had, it was a series of policies designed to allowing rampant exploitation of the crushed Southern economy by Northern businesses and investors.  And it did exactly that, crushed the Southerners who weren't wealthy businessmen and landowners.  

>Name one true constitutional democracy where collective punishment occurred

Oh, what an obviously dishonest question.  You are moving the goalposts and building into your question a series of assumptions that you can use to weasel out of accepting an answer to the more honest discussion your initial comment opened up.  Your qualifier of ""true"" constitutional democracy is your escape route.  No matter what I answer with, you'll declare the example is not a ""true"" democracy or not ""truly"" constitutional.  And all of that is a distraction because your initial comment was that collective punishment only occurred in dictatorships and communist regimes.  But now if I point to any form of collective punishment carried out by, say, England, you'll say that's a constitutional monarch and not a democracy and therefore it doesn't count.  That you chose to take the conversation that direction is very disappointing.

>Should Palestinians who are non-combatants suffer collectively for it?

Yes, they should, because they are not non-combatants.  They house Hamas's rockets and allow Hamas to stage their attacks in their neighborhoods.  They provide material support to Hamas.  You can argue that they are forced to do so, but the polling numbers showing they want the complete expulsion of Jews from Israel would call into question that conclusion.  

>No it’s a war crime.

So is invading a sovereign nation and killing or ejecting its people.  Yet, that's exactly what the Palestinians want and advocate for. 

>It is that collective punishment that gave the Nazis the ability to put all Jews in concentration camps because some Jews were communists

I'm going to mention a little Robert Heinlein philosophy here, something I probably do too often.  For those not familiar, Heinlein wrote hundreds of Science Fiction stories set in what was usually called ""Future History"".   In the 50s he actually drew out a timeline on a huge sheet of paper describing what happened when, and what stories were set in what part.   One major event was the Second American Revolution.  It was a revolt against a Theocratic dictatorship.  One outcome of the SAR was the Covenant, a kind of new bill of rights and one of the prime aspects of the Covenant was separation of Private and Public behavior. 

I was raised exactly the same way.  I remember when my parents found pot in my drawer at home.  That was a big no no at the time.  What my father, who very much disapproved,  told me was ""be careful, use your head, and don't let anyone know"".

[Bob Rae was incredibly reckless, almost tripling Ontario's debt from $35.4B to $90.7B in a single term in office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_government_debt).

Harris inherited a $10.1B budget deficit, and brought it to balance in 5 years. In 8 years, he added only $42B to the Ontario debt, about 25% less than Rae added in one term.

Harris (and his successor, Eves) left a balanced budget for McGuinty (600M surplus), yet McGuinty still managed to more than double the province's debt from $132.7B to $276.2B.

Wynne, then kept it up, taking the debt up to $323.8B, even while privatizing Hydro One to reduce the debt increase. That number doesn't even count the [$26B in ""improperly"" accounted energy grid debt](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hydro-auditor-general-report-fair-hydro-plan-wynne-1.4358168) Wynne tried to move off the books to make her numbers look better for the election she ended up losing.

Harris was the only responsible fiscal manager the province had for decades, and, while getting the books back in order, [he also managed to increase Ontario's GDP by 49.7% in 8 years](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/81-582-x/2009003/tbl/f.1.1-eng.htm) (including the year Ernie Eves spent in power after Harris stepped down, it's 45% in 7 years for Harris otherwise). 

For perspective, in the 8 years of Harris/Eves, the Ontario economy grew 49.7%, but in the 16 years of McGuinty/Wynne, [it only grew 30.98%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/577539/gdp-of-ontario-canada/). Meanwhile, Harris/Eves increased the debt by 46.3% in 8 years, while McGuinty/Wynne grew it by 244% in 16 years, despite Harris inheriting a $10B deficit, and McGuinty inheriting a surplus.

3) imo it was accidental- the people in the drivers seat were flipping ramaswamy off and were looking at him when they hit it. the street is very narrow and it’s a difficult spot to back out of; giving the drivers the benefit of the doubt, i tjibk they were simply too preoccupied with ramaswamy and didn’t pay enough attention to the space they had. i know the people in the car personally and they have said it was a genuine accident.

4) it was NOTTTT a hit and run! idk why sources keep reporting this. ramaswamy’s team immediately flagged the car down and the car stopped and cooperated. then, both cars left the scene to another location, my guess is to exchange insurance info.
