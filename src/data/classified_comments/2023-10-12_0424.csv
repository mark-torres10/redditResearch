In the very short time since this discussion thread was posted, today's vote for the House Speaker has apparently been postponed without being immediately rescheduled.  [Per the New York Times' live thread](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/11/us/house-speaker-vote-news/745258fd-a9a5-522c-8e7c-f89fe99e23e9):

k4gc2h2,Mythbuilder46,l0k5tmgxa,"So if I have this right:
- Republicans ousted their speaker in McCarthy without a backup plan
- They took a recess for a week just to continue to squabble over who is next (and continued to get paid)
- They still cannot figure their shit out, with their nominated speaker barely getting by in a secret vote
- Proceeded to take the rest of the day off because they didn’t want to embarrass themselves on tv again 

All while the Israel and Hamas situation unfolds
And all the while the government shutdown looms and we’ve already lost some 8 days to prevent one because of the BS.

There aren't five GOP reps that would put America over themselves like that.
