Acting like the GOP was functioning to begin with is absurd. McCarthy was brought in with skepticism. That skepticism turns out to have been well-deserved.

The optics always looked bad. 
  
*Wahhh this is a bad way to go into 2024*

With McCarthy we were walking into 2024 being certain failure. Are we going into it in pure chaos now? Sure. But is it certain failure? I'd say no.
  
It's a wildcard, it's drastic, and it's embarrassing in the short term -- but it's a spark of *someone* in Congress willing to pull the fucking pin for once.   
  
This party has been rightfully criticized (especially here) for playing nice, being worried about optics, playing into thr uniparty nonsense, and being shoved around. But once someone actually shoved back, we all start bitching and moaning? Really?
  
It's an insane move, but at least it's a fucking move. It's chaos, but at least it's not coasting into failure.

k3duv19,ClockmasterYT,13ec5u,"Takeaways:

- Republicans cut off their nose to spite their face.

- Democrats rewarded McCarthy for reaching across the aisle by helping oust him, thereby assuring Republicans that there is no benefit to bipartisanship.

- Gaetz and the Republicans who voted with him have now helped the Democrats more than McCarthy ever did.

- McCarthy's desperate bid to win the speakership earlier this year was an exercise in vanity that was doomed from the start.

- Republicans can't convincingly attack Biden for incompetence when their own conference is demonstrating historic incompetence. Independent voters notice things like this, and it's not a good look.

- Another thing that would have been a bad look is letting the government shut down days after announcing an impeachment inquiry.

The provisions of the deal included the withdrawal of all NATO troops from Afghanistan, a Taliban pledge to prevent al-Qaeda from operating in areas under Taliban control, and talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.[14] The United States agreed to an initial reduction of its force level from 13,000 to 8,600 by July 2020, followed by a full withdrawal within 14 months if the Taliban kept its commitments.[15] NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg pledged to bring down NATO's numbers to about 12,000 from roughly 16,000 troops.[16] The United States also committed to closing five military bases within 135 days,[13] and expressed its intent to end economic sanctions on the Taliban by August 27, 2020.",/r/Conservative/comments/172n3uf/no_wars/k3z3ink/,1696763903.0,r/Conservative,0.3313929,0,True,2023-10-16_0330

Remember when Trump had that one Iranian general killed? The one whose picture is now all over places like Theran or Bagdad like a great martyr ( which he is in the eyes of many powerful enemies of the USA and all the US-supports in that region )? 

How the Mullah regime said that they would find ways to pay this kind of thing back? 

That Trump normalised relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel does not seem like a further reason for Iran to try and gain populist support via a coordinated attack on Israel to drive a new wedge between Israel and their old rival? 

Especially now that their ally, Armenia, lost territory which also gives them bad standing as a protective power? 

I mean, would anyone claim Obama etc. being elected caused the great financial crisis of 2007/2008? I don‚Äôt think so, after all his administration was merely in charge when it happened. 

It would be like claiming that Trumps administration caused the problems with Afghanistan.

He certainly negotiated a final withdrawal with the Taliban and Biden happened to be in charge when this moment arrived but neither had much of a choice in the matter if a renewed escalation wasn‚Äôt an option. 

Trump furthermore simply continued to shift the focus of the US-American foreign policy away from Europe, like Obama & Bush before him, towards China and the pacific. 

For better and for worse he certainly didn‚Äôt give off ‚Äúworld police‚Äù type of president vibes. To ignore this makes us blind to the origins of today and the threats that we may face tomorrow.

k24urrw,Wee_Woo_Nee_Noor,agl8ptzy9,"Here is my previous comment: 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely a republican but I totally disagree about the republican stance on the war in Ukraine. America is supposed to be a force of good. We don‚Äôt get to sit this one out. I understand the apprehension of touching anything sleepy joe supports with a 10 foot pole but supporting Ukraine is something I believe is essential, Ukraine while not being a NATO country has massive implications for surrounding NATO countries. We need to show we are a reliable force to be relied upon, or our allies will realize there is nothing to be gained by being our allies. I‚Äôm ok with paying extra tax to be on the right side of history.‚Äù
My fear is that a cowardly conservative will get into office and encourage Ukraine to give up land to Russia which is probably as un-American as it gets, people seem to have forgotten how our country was formed‚Ä¶ We founded and devolved our colonies by ourselves under British rule while the British contributed nothing, so in 1775 we decided ‚Äúya know what we did all the work and built this land, so it‚Äôs ours‚Äù and the British didn‚Äôt like that so they enforced their tyrannical rule upon us. Meanwhile in Ukraine the Soviet Union dissolved 31 years ago and in that time Ukraine has worked and worked to turn its commie blocks into beautiful cities, then in 2014 Russia decided they wanted their sticky hands on that land. Sound familiar? Because it should. 

America was and should always be a force against tyranny, foreign and domestic.

As for China's military, the US military has traditionally overestimated it's foes significantly, from the USSR to Iraq during the first gulf war. If anything China is probably much weaker than they appear to be.

Furthermore, the Chinese military is untested, while the US has been testing it's latest military equipment against a peer adversary in Russia, spotting the weaknesses and improving them. This alone would make the investment worthwhile, let alone other benefits which I mentioned.

Well, I have to say, I think it‚Äôs very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where you‚Äôre supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia. So we‚Äôre protecting Germany. We‚Äôre protecting France. We‚Äôre protecting all of these countries. And then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia, where they‚Äôre paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia.

So we‚Äôre supposed to protect you against Russia, but they‚Äôre paying billions of dollars to Russia, and I think that‚Äôs very inappropriate. And the former Chancellor of Germany is the head of the pipeline company that‚Äôs supplying the gas. Ultimately, Germany will have almost 70 percent of their country controlled by Russia with natural gas.

So you tell me, is that appropriate? I mean, I‚Äôve been complaining about this from the time I got in. It should have never been allowed to have happened.

...

So we have to talk about the billions and billions of dollars that‚Äôs being paid to the country that we‚Äôre supposed to be protecting you against. You know, everybody is talking about it all over the world. They‚Äôll say, well, wait a minute, we‚Äôre supposed to be protecting you from Russia, but why are you paying billions of dollars to Russia for energy? Why are countries in NATO, namely Germany, having a large percentage of their energy needs paid to Russia and taken care of by Russia?

Now, if you look at it, Germany is a captive of Russia because they supply. They got rid of their coal plants. They got rid of their nuclear. They‚Äôre getting so much of the oil and gas from Russia. I think it‚Äôs something that NATO has to look at. I think it‚Äôs very inappropriate.

k2smssa,CharmCityCrab,38eey,"**Short answer-**

No.  He can run as many times as he wants, but he can only win twice.  Technically, if he serves the two terms (Even non-consecutively), he can't run again after that, but that's only after a hypothetical second term, not after another loss.  He can run and lose forever until he gets that second term or dies- if he wants to keep running.  He could even legally run from prison if he winds up there.

The only President ever to be elected to two *non-consecutive* terms was Grover Cleveland.

**Long answer-**

The constitutional limit is that you can only serve two terms.  This was at first just a tradition begun by George Washington, the first President under the present 1789 constitution, who chose to only serve two terms, but then a constitutional amendment was passed legally after Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) was elected to, I think, four terms, in the Great Depression/World War 2 era.

FDR might have been re-elected to even more terms ***if*** he hadn't suffered a bad heart attack or something of that nature during his last term.  He was very popular- credited with both getting us out of the Great Depression and winning World War 2 (Though Truman mopped up in the Pacific after FDR died in office.  Truman is also the one who decided to drop the nukes on Japan.  I'm not saying FDR wouldn't have done it- we'll never know if he would have or wouldn't have.).  We also have FDR to thank for Social Security, though I think in fairness I should at least mention the huge black mark on his record- the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War 2 (Trivia: George Takei, the original Lt. Sulu on Star Trek, who is still alive, had his family interned when he was a child and still has memories of that time.).

To be clear, Roosevelt was well within his legal rights to serve all those terms, because the two term ""limit"" was only a very informal tradition back then, but it is the law now, and a modern President would not be.

The only ways around that are:

\- Pass a constitutional amendment changing the law, which would be virtually impossible in the current political climate because of the high threshold of support it'd need.   It's been a while since a constitutional amendment for anything was passed.

There's a long argument about whether or not the Equal Rights Amendment (for women) was enacted or not, but the short version is that the courts do not recognize it as having been enacted, so it is not functionally law, though some people think the courts are wrong.  It's not relevant to Trump anyhow.

\- Be Vice-President when a President passes away, after which \*I think\* in certain cases, if you're just briefly President under those circumstances, it may not count against the two term limit (But that would probably never apply to Trump- I can't see him running for Vice-President at this point \[Another improbable scenario- if no one gets 270 electoral votes in a Presidential election, I think the House picks the President and the Senate picks the VP, which could result in a Biden-Trump or a Trump-Biden administration (I'm not sure if it's the outgoing or incoming Congress that votes).  I don't think that's ever happened, though.  In order for it to happen, there would almost certainly have to be a third party candidate who wins some states and blocks the leading vote getter from hitting 270, and there's no one projected to be running who could do that right now.  Things can change, but... probably not.\].  And it'd have to be a situation where he hadn't already served a second term as President, like he becomes VP and then is elevated to the Presidency briefly at the end of his running mate's term, and then is allowed to run again.  If he's served two full terms as President, he's not even eligible to *run* for Vice-President.).

\- Turn America in an autocracy or authoritarian state and just ignore the constitution and the law and declare yourself dictator for life, hold an illegal plebiscite where people vote you into office for life, run for a third term even though it's clearly illegal and somehow get on the ballot and get the Senate to illegal receive the electors, or get the Supreme Court to rule against the clear meaning of a constitutional amendment that was solely enacted to prevent that.

Everything under option three would be the end of American democracy and the legitimate rule of law.

&#x200B;

But he can legally keep running until he gets that second term or dies- if he wants to.

President Biden has actually run for President 3 times- 1988, 2008, and 2020 (Though he only ran in the primaries the first two times, failing to get his party's nomination).  2024 will his 4th time running for President.

Jimmy Carter is on only other living one-term President other than Donald Trump and, I guess, Joe Biden, though Biden could still win in 2024 and be a two consecutive term President.  Technically, Carter could run again if he wanted to, but he recently turned 99 years old, was in hospice care a few months ago, hasn't shown an interest in running for anything in 40+ years, and voted for Joe Biden in 2020, so it would be beyond shocking if he actually did it.  He just legally would be allowed to.

I think there are some third-party candidates who kept running again and again in the past, losing every time, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.  Everyone that comes to mind only ran once or twice.  But I just have a vaguely recollection of seeing some people toss their hats in the ring constantly.  I know Ross Perot only ran twice (Random historical note: Donald Trump strongly considered running for Ross Perot's Reform Party's 2000 nomination to the point where he had political advisors mailing free copies of his book to Reform Party activists and was criticizing Pat Buchanan, the eventual Reform Party nominee that year.  Ironically, one of the big things he criticized Buchanan and his supporters for were what he claimed were ties to David Duke.  David Duke endorsed Trump when Trump ran as a Republican in 2016, and when asked by the press if he'd denounced Duke's endorsement, Trump claimed to not know who he was, an obvious lie.  For the sake of clarity, I should mention that Perot wasn't a far-right guy like the people who took over his party in 2000 when he decided not to run.).  I think Ralph Nader and Ron Paul only ran twice, but I could be wrong about either or both of them.

In any event, yes, Trump can keep running until he wins (After which he'd be constitutionally barred from running again), passes away, or gets sick of running.

Realistically, I would think after a second loss, assuming he didn't stage a successful coup afterward, his support would probably drop in every subsequent election he'd lose.  His whole brand is projecting the false impression that he's a winner when it comes to everything he tries.  The more he loses, the more hits that image will take among his supporters and potential supporters.

**Disclaimer:** I did 99% of this from memory.  It's just too much information for me to go look it all up and double check that it's all correct.  So, if you need it for something important- please double check.

Sex isn't binary even for humans, and gender is not the same as sex.

There are a number of sex genetic conditions that can influence one's physiology and consequently their hormone balance, and thus gender identity.

Anger, frustration, outrage, sure, but hatred?  I doubt it.  
  
And to bring this all around: Would you have preferred if your coworker had been better educated?  If they'd experienced more diversity of persons and opinions when they were growing up?  That they'd had people who cared about them enough to point them in a better direction, or more persuasive and empathetic voices to pull them away from the hate?  If you're a liberal, there's probably a part of you that sees how the system and society have both failed your patient *and* failed your coworker.

Oh, shit!  Okay, sorry, I mistook you.  
  
Let me try it this way: I was accused of hating conservatives in another thread earlier today, and it's not the first time that accusation has been leveled at me or at liberals as a whole.  And I *don't* hate conservatives.  
  
You're telling me I'm not special, and you're absolutely right, I'm *not* special.  *Most* liberals don't hate conservatives, so hearing someone *say* ""You're just a liberal because you hate conservatives"" gets under my skin.  
  
I called this post a rant, and that's what it is, a rant.  Because you're right, this occurrence isn't *special,* it's fucking *boring* and *banal,* it happens thousands of times a day, and it's that fucking **ubiquity** that gets under my skin.  
  
I'm not special, I didn't write this because I think I'm special, I wrote this because I'm sick of interactions like these being so normal nowadays.  Who likes it when people make wrong assumptions about them?

I've posted part of this before, but this is the story that got me to not care. I have a MAGA neighbor who is on disability. Last fall, his wife got Covid.

Sunday night went back to the ER where she stayed for a week. She never got vaxxed.

The husband has Parkinsons, diabetes, etc. Never ""got the jab"" never wore a mask. He now has covid for the 2nd time. He was diagnosed on a Thursday. Went to the casino on Friday and Saturday and now is supposedly bedridden.  I assume it's bad. He is 4 months behind on his HOA dues and his wife explained ""he has Covid and is very sick can you give us a break."" My response was simply NO.

Based on the fact that Trump must win 3 of the 5 states above plus hold all the 2020 red states (North Carolina, Alaska and Montana will all require varying amounts of effort to hold; effort that can't go towards conquering the Blue Wall), I honestly don't think Trump has any more than a 10% chance of winning as we sit here today.

That's just finding a justification. It's not like it's a contest between an 80 year old man and a 50 year old criminal.  It's literally a contest between a 77 year old criminal who is demonstrably unfit to lead and who has destroyed the country and a slightly older man, who happens to be the incumbent, and who has more success than I ever anticipated.

The people that claim that the 3 year age difference between an octogenarian and a 77 year old criminally indicted (probably convicted, at least once if not 4 times by election day) racist, ragingly narcissistic who only cares about himself, insurrectionist are straight up lying.

1) the mod wing of both parties cut a deal to co-govern.  The left of the dem party doesn‚Äôt have as much control as the right wing of the GOP, but I think mods are tired of it and want to show some strength.  So blue dog Dems and whatever the republicans call theirs.    There‚Äôs easily 200 Congress people that would be from the opposite party if they moved to a different state.  All those folks.  





2) we get fed some bs about how the parties are uniting because the country is in crisis, yada yada yada.  But it‚Äôs basiclly all the corporate funded politicians that have been controlling the government forever. 





3) government ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù for a while.  Biden gets re-elected.  But in ‚Äò26, everyone in this moderate caucus gets a challenger from their left or right in the primary.  This is cuz they continued to prob up big business and crush the common folk.  We continued to produced poor people at an insane rate like we are now.  





4) one of the parties will fracture.  My money is on the republicans.  The right will split with the mods.  We‚Äôre seeing these cracks already.  Mostly it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs already infrastructure for a real Conservative Party.  Tv stations, operatives, tons of money.  If the Dems split, it‚Äôs be labor and left splitting off.  Either way, the ‚Äúintact‚Äù party loses all its mods to the other party.  So now there‚Äôs three parties, left, mid/mod, right.  Upper middle class and middle class folks will claim they‚Äôre not extreme and be in the moderate party run by rich people.  The right and left will be filled with broke working class folks.  This split is so interesting to me cuz there will be a lot of racial tensions, and economic.  But where will the majority of the lgbtq powers end up?





5) with global turmoil and massive climate issues, AOC will run for President.  Not a normal basic presidential campaign.  But a movement that is meant to sweep her in to office as well as an entire 220+ congressional caucus that will support her.




Either 1 of two things will happen.  A) she wins and we try to save the planet by eating the rich. Or b) some for of mod ticket (former dem + former rep.) wins.  Think‚Ä¶. Mark warner + John kasich.  Either way‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm aware Hamas is increasingly ‚Äúpopular‚Äù among disaffected Palestinians, especially youth. Almost a century of living under apartheid-driven occupation might radicalize more than a few people. 

To be clear, I do not think this action, or pretty much any by Hamas is a good thing. However, contextually, the daily violence and repression experienced by Palestinians have driven them to respond this way. I agree with your point about Palestinian leadership. My point in putting ‚Äúpopular‚Äù in air quotes is to indicate that this support is contextual - that many Palestinians under different conditions would not support this, but now feel as if they have been backed into a corner. 

Sociologically speaking, violence often reflects significant unmet societal needs: I think here, the unmet needs are pretty obvious, and are being deliberately perpetrated by an occupying settler colonial state determined to expel or eradicate the presence of Arabs in the region. Last I heard, less than 10% of people have running clean water in Gaza. I‚Äôve even heard people justify this by saying: we‚Äôll Arabs like living in sand and filth (anecdotal yes; but the fact Ben Shapiro is also known for saying this suggests it‚Äôs a more widely accepted belief). A peaceful protest by Palestinians a few years ago near the wall in Gaza resulted in something like ~30 000 wounded and more than 200 dead. That doesn‚Äôt even factor in the invasion of Al Aqsa, the illegal occupations in the West Bank, and more. It‚Äôs fucking gross behaviour you‚Äôd expect from Nazis and South African apartheid supporters. 

The point of what I‚Äôm saying is Israel is far from blameless in this conflict (as everyone should know). To glibly say that 60% of Palestinians support beating and stripping a woman naked, tying her to a car, and parading her around because generally speaking some Palestinians support Hamas because they feel it‚Äôs their only viable option for political independence/liberation is a gross mischaracterization.

Support for armed resistance is not, yet again, as you said earlier: ‚Äúprobably 60% of Palestinians watched the video‚Ä¶ and cheered.‚Äù Those are vastly different statements so you better have some data or try and walk that statement back a bit. 

Moving onto your point about development: whether or not it is a higher level of development than apartheid is not the qualification for apartheid fun fact. It can still be apartheid and be slightly better conditions than the conditions of South Africa today. Those two are not mutually exclusive. Apartheid is a political concept with actual definitions and tools of repression. Such as the forced relocation of people, the restriction of movement, habitation, and economic opportunities, second class citizenship with restricted political and social rights, lack of access to basic amenities or services like running water, consistent access to food, education, stable incomes or families. Not to mention the constant threat of violence living in an open air prison. 

I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt like the term, but that‚Äôs just your emotions getting in the way. In addition; Palestine is .002 above South Africa‚Äôs metric.  It‚Äôs not exactly leaps and bounds. While Israel is .204 above Palestine - a stark difference in development. Almost like Palestinians are subject to a completely different set of rules and laws within Israel which relegate them to poverty. Also, if you talk to any South African; they will tell you in some ways not much has really changed for average people in South Africa since apartheid ended. It‚Äôs really depressing. 

I actually used facts and emotion, because both are relevant here. The living conditions are deplorable by any standard. You use the term ‚Äúrelative‚Äù to compare development levels of Palestine with the rest of the Levant, but ignore the relative level of development compared to the literal country which currently occupies it. To me, this is incredibly dishonest. Normal people condemn the average living conditions of people in the Levant and want to see them improved. You see them as justifications to suppress Palestinians because others live like that. The way you have approached this conversation I find to be really misleading or disingenuous. I hope people realize that you aren‚Äôt engaging in an honest way, or maybe you‚Äôre just ‚Äúuninformed‚Äù or are allowing ‚Äúemotional arguments‚Äù to get in the way as you said. Who is to say.

A couple of things:

1. I understand how to use quotes just fine, thx.  Often I'll use them as ironic stressors.
2. ""These people"" might actually be capable (or not) of electing a sane party, if they weren't under continual occupation. But it's absurd to think a people under military rule can do anything in their rational, long-term self interest.
3. Yeah, there IS an actual way to give ""these people"" self-determination.  We did it with the ""uncivilized children"" of the Philippines.  We did it with the ""incapable of having a democracy, unless we bomb them into it,"" Iraq.  We did it with ""Oops, 20yr occupation: time to go--here's the keys, Al Qaeda!"" Afghanistan.  ""We"" even did it with the 1st democracy ever--Haiti--but only if they paid France back for the slaves' lost (which they finally did. In 1945).
4. The point to #3--there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" way to hand over a long, brutal occupation (just ask England!): but it eventually HAS to be done--if you're not a nation governed by mottos like ""might makes right,"" or ""we win: you lose, now die.""
5. These people seemed to govern themselves just FINE (more or less successfully as any other nation), before the Occupation. The Occupation is an apartheid system designed to support Israel, that's it.  The only thing Palestinians' get from it is a loss of self-determination; and a short, miserable life.",/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/172zqww/is_violence_in_selfdefense_justified/k42bq2w/,1696810393.0,r/PoliticalDiscussion,0.47958523,0,True,2023-10-16_0330

Word, hand, fist, club, taser, gun. Go in progression, and try to deescalate if possible, such as by creating distance. If there's not an imminent threat, don't hurt someone if you can just break up a fight.

One thing he didn't talk about, but which I guess I assumed was implicit, is that you definitely only use force **on the person posing the imminent threat**. Threatening to hit someone else if the dangerous person doesn't stop is, well, unjustifiable.

k40vgsf,notpoleonbonaparte,nuv1b4zq,"Ideally, you would fight back against your attacker directly. I mean, it's the entire basis of our rules around war. Civilians aren't targets because civilians are not your enemy, they're not involved. That's where all of this gets tricky. 

Hamas would say their targeting of civilians is justified because it's Palestinian civilians who are being victimized by the Israelis. 

Israel would say that they try their best not to hit civilians, but if they do, it's justified because Hamas uses their own civilians as human shields. 

In Israel we see war reduced to its most basic and brutal I think. It's all of us, against all of you. And yet, no matter what even the most enthusiastic Palestinian might tell you, Israel is not fighting a total war against Palestinians. If they were, there would be no more Palestine. So, therefore, they are exercising some degree of restraint. 

Contrast this, with what happened yesterday. Would Palestine exercise similar restraint if the roles were reversed? Because I saw the footage from yesterday. For a brief period, in small areas of Israel, the roles were reversed. And you cannot tell me that that was the equivalent to what Israel has been doing for the last decades. I have never seen footage of an IDF soldier machine gunning random people at a bus stop. I have not seen an IDF soldier lining people up against a wall in a bomb shelter. Kidnapping ~50 women, shooting up a music festival full of young people, or launching unguided munitions at heavily populated areas. I watched a video of Palestinians parading around the body of a young German girl though the streets. Has the IDF done that? 

They're not the same thing. Palestine can only pretend they have any kind of moral high ground by referring to some vaguely defined historical injustices. When Israel actually stops making the distinction between soldier and civilian, the world will know. It won't need Palestinian news organizations to spin it all properly first. Even today, Israel's airstrikes are still roof-tapping first. If Palestine had an air force, would they? Because their rockets don't.

k41s8s8,I-Make-Maps91,dmal85z9,">According to several historians, between 10 and 70 massacres occurred during the 1948 war. According to Benny Morris the Yishuv (or later Israeli) soldiers killed roughly 800 Arab civilians and prisoners of war in 24 massacres. Aryeh Yizthaki list 10 major massacres with more than 50 victims each.Palestinian researcher Salman Abu-Sitta lists 33 massacres, half of them occurring during the civil war period. Saleh Abdel Jawad lists 68 villages where acts of indiscriminate killing of prisoners, and civilians took place, where no threat was posed to Yishuv or Israeli soldiers.  
  
The main massacres and attacks against Jewish civilians were the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre where 39 Jews were killed by Arab workers after Irgun members had thrown a bomb into the crowd and the Kfar Etzion massacre where around 120-150 residents and defenders were killed by Arab irregulars, according to some accounts with the participation of Arab Legion soldiers. The Hadassah medical convoy massacre, with 80 deaths, included the mass killing of medical personnel by Arabs.  
  
According to Rosemarie Esber, both Israeli archives and Palestinian testimonies confirm killings occurred in numerous Arab villages. Most of these killings occurred as villages were overrun and captured during the Second phase of the Civil War, Operation Dani, Operation Hiram and Operation Yoav. Morris said that the ""worst cases"" were the Saliha massacre with 60 to 70 killed, the Deir Yassin massacre with around 112, the Lydda massacre with around 250, and the Abu Shusha massacre with 60‚Äì70. In Al-Dawayima, accounts of the death toll vary. Saleh Abd al-Jawad reports 100-200 casualties, Morris has estimated ""hundreds"" and also reports the IDF investigation which concluded 100 villagers had been killed. David Ben-Gurion gave the figure of 70‚Äì80. Saleh Abd al-Jawad reports on the village's mukhtar account that 455 people were missing following the al-Dawayima massacre, including 170 women and children.  
  
Controversy surrounds the assertion that a massacre by Israelis took place at Tantura.

Well, there's the Naqba, which would be the closest comparison for Hamas.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings\_and\_massacres\_during\_the\_1948\_Palestine\_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_and_massacres_during_the_1948_Palestine_war)

>In February 1983, a commission chaired by Se√°n MacBride, the assistant to the UN Secretary General and President of United Nations General Assembly at the time, looking into reported violations of International Law by Israel concluded that Israel, as the camp's occupying power, bore responsibility for the violence. The commission also concluded that the massacre was a form of genocide.  
  
In February 1983, the Israeli Kahan Commission, appointed to investigate the incident, found that Israeli military personnel, aware that a massacre was in progress, had failed to take serious steps to stop it. The commission deemed Israel indirectly responsible, and Ariel Sharon, then Defense Minister, bore personal responsibility ""for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge"", forcing him to resign

Then there's the time the Israelis sat around while the soldiers they trained committed what the UN described as a genocide in a camp the Israelis ran.

Controversial bills often get passed at the end of the session, when the lawmakers put up or shut up. So Newsom is facing the politically thorniest legislation now and making the final call on which bills he considers too extreme.

Newsom wants to run for president in 2028 (or 2024 if Biden drops out), but he knows that California has a national reputation as a bastion of liberal dysfunction. So he's trying to show he's a moderate by vetoing bills that *sound* socialist or culture-war-y. 

For instance, he vetoed a bill that would require a judge to consider whether each parent affirms a child's self-identified gender identity when deciding custody battles. Lots of progressives would say, ""Of course! We don't want a child with an intolerant parent."" And lots of people around the country think, ""Wait. If I get divorced and my five-year-old boy says he's a girl today, a judge will cancel my custody if I express doubt?"" Newsom looked at that bill and said, ""Jesus, the voters will crucify me if I sign this.""

If the $35 co-pay cap were in place, then the average person is going to be choosing between the $30 product and the $35 product from a large brand.
