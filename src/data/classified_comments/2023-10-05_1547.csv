The reason why the space shuttle was so ineffective was due to Nixon's interference.

What was intended to be a cislunar system was shackled to low-earth orbit, greatly limiting our ability to push the frontiers of space exploration.

Sure, we had a few space stations, but reduced lift capacity meant they were slow to assemble and difficult to update.  We've had to live with the shuttle until entropy made them too dangerous to fly and the system aged out.  Now, with the SLS, we finally have the thrust to get back to the moon.
