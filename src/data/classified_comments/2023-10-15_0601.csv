k4tydzy,TheAutisticKaren,gea0y2k3x,"Oh 1000000000000000000000000%.

I'm from Ukraine, my husband is from Russia but he has mixed blood with Ukraine and Indigenous tribes. 

He does not want to go back under any circumstances because of how crap life was there.

My family that lived in Belgorod said surprisingly that their life was better than what it was back in Kharkiv, but that's not really comforting because they were very poor and discriminated against.

There's just so much stigma associated with normal things in Russia to this day. My family ""evolved"" over time and became more westernised but whenever I see someone I know come here from Russia or even at times Ukraine, there's a lot of assimilation that has to happen.

While the differences are stark, I do feel like it is also a huge opportunity to improve quality of life in the ways you mentioned. 

I'd also add:

- stop conscription
 
- close off environmentally unsafe areas

- stop starting wars at all, idk what war is necessary

- let go of the ""Russia is going to take over the world"" mindset and seriously start focusing as you said, on economic prosperity. This is the sad thing about Russia - there are so many highly educated, brilliant minds there but the reputation is so fucked up that nobody trusts anything that comes from there, even if it's good.

- focus on forging close relationships with neighbours and acknowledgement and apologies to countries that Russia fucked things up for 

- get rid of the forced Orthodox religion that's corrupting the country even worse

- actually stop the corruption ffs 

- allow free speech, right to protest, right to criticise the government - monitor it like the NSA but listen to the criticism and think about if it's valid

- stop aiding terrorist organisations and countries 

Basically, Russia would need to be safe, predictable and have a better track record for change than Germany for people like my husband and I to move there. It'd need to be more attractive than Australia. I do feel like as a Ukranian from Kharkiv who speaks Russian, if it became awesome, I'd actually love to go there but to be clear, that would be not Russia as it is today, but the same land, maybe with the language, some of the food & traditional dances / customs that are similar to what we have in Ukraine - but really, pretty much nothing else.

Worse - ~~he sued, and won, a defamation lawsuit 5 years ago~~ for $7,500 because someone called him gay.

EDIT: my Hungarian is terrible and the tweet I read was incorrect. This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.

*According to the first-instance verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Klára Ungár will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*

*Klára Ungár, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted Máté Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*

*Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that Máté Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*",/r/worldnews/comments/k4qide/an_antigay_hungarian_politician_has_resigned/geax3ef/,1606859232.0,r/worldnews,0.6423419,1,True,2023-10-15_0601

geaerm7,inpennysname,354q7c37,"Ok so one time when I first moved to my city and was walking my dog late at night I ran into a meth head in the park who was doing yoga in the dark and started a conversation with me. I was naive and bc this person seemed harmless (just like super chatty and had SO much energy) I stayed and listened to their stories. Why were they in dc? For a regular gay orgy, he told me. He told me about how many gay orgies happen in dc with politicians and how many closeted gay/anti gay politicians were at those parties. He offered me some weed from his truck and curious to hear more, I followed this man. He got distracted when sorting through some free furniture on the side of the road and pulled two duffel bags full of dildos out of his car, and I headed out. Oh to be a young woman in the city again.",/r/worldnews/comments/k4qide/an_antigay_hungarian_politician_has_resigned/geaerm7/,1606850681.0,r/worldnews,0.26569152,0,True,2023-10-15_0601

geb54cu,JustTransGuyThings,5e4z09u6,I definitely had the best summer of my life partying at some older friends’ house when I was 20. They were old enough to buy booze and they’d have these wild and insane parties so I met a lot of interesting people that summer. I only discovered after I left to go back to school that it was a METH HOUSE and they were literally DOING METH ALL SUMMER.,/r/worldnews/comments/k4qide/an_antigay_hungarian_politician_has_resigned/geb54cu/,1606863157.0,r/worldnews,0.9956817,1,True,2023-10-15_0601
