He saw how everyone who was against the state, was labelled as an enemy, traitor and was brutally tortured to change his opinion and got eradicated.

Edit: just wanted to say that with each passing day I love this sub more and more. Especially in the aftermath of everything that's happening in Palestine and Israel, it's nice to see such level headed conversations take place, and I'm not sure that I've seen that in literally any other sub. 

One of my best friends was an immigrant from Gaza who moved to NYC at 24. I spent countless hours picking his brain over this stuff because he was a very proud Palestinian, and **very** anti-Hamas. In his eyes they were Netanyahu's puppets, and from what I understand this is quite a common sentiment amongst Palestinians (or was until recently anyway). He passed away two years ago from an undiagnosed heart disease (shocking too because the man was built like a brick shithouse and was a fitness nut). Easily one of the kindest people I've ever met, and while I've always been one to have a soft spot for clearly oppressed people, I became very sympathetic to his cause. My heart truly breaks for the civilians of Palestine who don't want anything to do with conflict. Who understand Hamas is **NOT** representing them. It's just a shit situation all together.

k4pgodk,iowaboy,3hwpo,"I don’t think enough people are talking about Israel closing the Rafah crossing (and am really glad this guy mentions it). The Rafah crossing is with Egypt—the most neutral actor in the region. Egypt wants peace in Gaza for it’s own selfish reasons (war on your border is bad for business and tourism). Egypt is also opposed to Hamas (aggressively shutting down Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt). And yet Israel has bombed the Rafah crossing to prevent Palestinian civilians from leaving the strip (which is 1/3 the size of NYC), and threatened to bomb the aid caravan that Egypt was sending to Gaza (forcing the caravan to turn back).

This is particularly important because Israel’s line recently has been that it’s not their responsibility to support Gaza. Even if that were true (it’s not, since Israel has withheld the aid sent to Gaza by other countries in the past decades, claiming to be responsible for distributing it), Israel is responsible for actively preventing others from sending humanitarian support. And Israel has no reason to cut off the Rafah crossing other than in an effort to maximize the suffering and death of Gazan civilians.",/r/socialism/comments/176j91b/youre_not_defending_yourself_by_starving_the/k4pgodk/,1697205569.0,r/socialism,0.82909214,1,True,2023-10-16_0412

So you see, it's better to have 2x the housing needed, even if 10% of the population is unhoused because the rich hoard it than it is to just target enough housing for everyone.

Socialism is about ringing in a new era for humanity, one that's more enlightened and pragmatically structured.

A) why do you think the ""existential aspect"" is ""more influential"" than a systemic function for a systemic phenomenon (i.e. religion is social and organized)?

B) why do you think an existential aspect has nothing to do with coping? 

C) in my *religious studies* program in the 90s, we were reading Marx as a proto-existentialist, so these elements -Marx, social structure, alienation, etc. - aren't as void of the existential as you are presenting. Both are reactions to Hegel.

However, on the first point, there are system theoretical reasons for the supposition. The idea is that class struggle has been a driver of change throughout history, and that change has looked a certain way because of it. So while society has gone through many changes, because of classes existing, things like stratification and oppression have always played a part in how that change happens and how it turns out. In a system without classes, according to their theory, the period of class struggle would be over. Change would keep happening, but not by exploting or creating class divisions.  It’s a vision of a society where people who want more are cheered on by their comrades, because one person’s plenty does not detract from another’s. A society where the values of cooperation and community are institutionalised, rather than competition and individualism.

k4jc2jj,MortRouge,5xddq,"I think it's pretty easy to say that the situation isn't complex AND a clusterfuck. It's pretty easy: 
One ethnic group (Jews) was displaced from the region (Palestine) by the Roman Empire in the first to second century and eventually became turned into a religious scapegoat as the Roman Empire developed Christianity. Jews were one of the few Ethnic groups that kept an in ethnic coupling to their religion, as was the common way of religion in antiquity. Over the millenia, the religious hate for Jews gradually turned into a racism, anti-Semitism. Jews were industrially murdered in the Holocaust.
Across this entire history, there are attempts to move back to Palestine - Israel doesn't just pop up in the 40's. This increases during the 19th century.

Without considering the creation of modern Israel, it's already a clusterfuck because the displacement and ethnical cleansing of Jews have continually been intervowen into several systems of oppression in Christian culture. Jews have been second rate citizens, they have been scapegoated several times before the 20th century.

And then the World powers decide to solve this clusterfuck by giving it an ethnostate. Muslims and other Palestinians already were entangled with the problem, and now they became extremely entangled.

The solutions aren't very complex, but it will take extreme political work that isn't in place in order for Jews to be able to live peacefully in Palestine, and a ethnostate has only made that worse.

I think the crux of the matter regarding HAMAS is that when the west labels them terrorist they do so in a way that strips the issue of any nuance or further analysis. They are immediately portrayed as the caricature terrorist [a rabid fanatic devoid of thought or compassion] and separated from the Palestinian people.

k4h89iu,PM_ME_DPRK_CANDIDS,f44kcwq,"**Is Hamas a Terrorist group? Yes and No.** Terrorism is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

In this sense, Hamas is absolutely a terrorist group, the same way the anti-slavery fighter John Brown was a ""terrorist"", anti-fascist Jewish partisans were ""terrorists"", and so on.

Hamas has attacked the ""civilian"" colonial settlers of Israel.

However, as a matter of international law, UN General Assembly resolution 37/43 adopted in 1982 considers armed struggle against colonial and foreign domination or occupation legitimate, and rightly assigns the crime of terrorism to the military groups created to enforce colonial rule such as the IDF.

I think a more accurate descriptor for Hamas is anti-colonial resistance. The use of the term Terrorist is politically motivated to avoid discussion of the key issue - Israeli colonialism.

**Is Hamas like the Taliban? Yes and no.** The Taliban is a  uniformly far-right Islamic theocratic-nationalist group, seeking to re-establish an Islamic caliphate through the violent deposition of American-backed semi-democratic states.

Hamas is an Islamic anti-colonial group with a mixture of political tendencies that share the goal of ending Israeli colonial rule. It is generally right wing and would prefer to establish an Islamic state, however it's willing to work with the greater Palestinian liberation movement to establish a secular state. In this hypothetical secular state - it would continue to push it's ideology of an Islamic state, but on a democratic not violent basis.

In other words it's pretty damn far right by our standards as socialists. **However**  it's place in the objective historical process is the construction of democracy in Palestine. The Taliban and other ""Terrorist"" groups seek to destroy the limited democracy they have.

If you want to actually get working class politicians into power then you need to start on the local level because it’s going to be a lot easier for you to organize around a city council election than a national election.  And I’d argue that the city councilor has a lot more impact on the every day lives of working class people than the president does.

This exact mechanism of extortion is and always has been how the US has orchestrated the charade of democracy. Giving into it doesn't reduce the risk of fascism at all.

The 'dire' situation today is *because* of people voting democrat without fail. Hence this strategy is literally PROVEN to be complete a failure.

There's no organizing, no corruption, no self awareness and no strategizing more long term than the first next election outcome.

""Dismantling the Empire

Vastly cutting back on military spending, dissolving non-defensive security alliances, including NATO and AUKUS, dismantling the global network of over 800 military bases and severing the link between U.S. foreign policy and corporate profits to respect national sovereignty and the principle of self-determination for people. The USA should be a decent and dignified nation among nations rather than an imperial power dominating every corner of the globe. Withdrawing foreign aid to Egypt, Israel, and any other countries violating the human rights of subjugated peoples. Increasing humanitarian aid to poor and vulnerable peoples around the world. Enabling international peace by highlighting ecological sustainability, abolishing nuclear weapons, and promoting diplomatic processes.

Unleashing Democracy

Massive investments in satisfying the social needs of everyday people. Medicare for all including humane mental healthcare, decriminalization of drugs, and creation of humane rehabilitation sites. Decent housing for all, quality education for all, free college tuition for all, and jobs with living wages for all. Abolishing poverty and houselessness. Targeting the vicious legacy of white supremacy by ending mass incarceration, demilitarizing policing (abolishing Cop-Cities), and promoting reparations for past unjust treatment of Black people. Prioritizing the empowerment of indigenous peoples. Protecting the reproductive rights of women and ending all forms of patriarchy. Securing the rights of LGBTQ+ and Trans-Peoples. Treating every migrant and asylum seeker with dignity and implementing fundamental changes in immigration policies. Public financing of elections with ranked-choice voting, eliminating the Electoral College and a national holiday for voting. Democratizing unaccountable monopolies and oligopolies with workers' control.""

Unless voting booths are inaccessible to you, which admittedly isn't uncommon at all, national elections barely take any time at all.

If you care about winning you're the one falling for the farce. You're right that national elections are meaningless for anyone expecting direct material effects, but it DOES offer the opportunity of promoting the socialist platform. 

And that's what actually matters. We all know the US isn't going to let a socialist get any significant state power in a million years *no matter* how they go about it. The point of parties like the Green Party, which is a great democratic socialist and disciplined activist party, is that they can actually confront contradictions that the established parties actively choose to distract people from.

That's because they formed big mass movements around parties and kept fighting and losing and fighting and losing till they eventually won.

k2roc46,beam-attacks,avl41awn,"Right now, Green party membership sits at about 230,000. If all of the socialist or even pseudo socialist parties in the entire country, including DSA which is generally opposed to running outside of the Democratic party, the combined membership would be about half of that, give or take. If the Green party, a group with arguably far more name recognition than any socialist organization in the country (although I suppose DSA has gained a reputation since 2016) has been unable to successfully win even one state in a presidential election in its entire history, there's very little reason to think that a single unified socialist party could make much of a dent on the electoral front.

It's not just a numbers game either; small groups have historically been more than capable of punching above their weight, but the fact of the matter is that the programs of all these different groups aren't going to be compatible. Lots of groups reject the notion of electoralism outright, and there would be constant arguing about principles like democratic centralism or revolution vs. reform, questions which go beyond petty infighting and have serious implications for what kind of candidate would even be selected to run, not to mention what their campaign would look like.

I admire your optimism, but for the foreseeable future I wouldn't hold out hope that something like this is possible. The good news is that electoralism isn't the only way forward for a socialist future. There's loads of other, far more effective ways to improve people's lives and build towards a socialist future.

k36v16c,LizzySea33,w4jf4lug,">Paul says that slaves are to obey their master's, that the ruling powers of government are decreed by God and rebellion against them is to go against gods will.

Well: let's look at Romans 13 shall we?

According to the writing I have (NKJV) it says, 

""Let every soul be subject to the governing athourities. For there is no athourity except from God and the athourities that exist are appointed by God. Those who resist the athourity resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgement on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil. Do you want to be afraid of the athourity? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same. For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience' sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God's ministers attending continually to this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.

Romans 13:1-7

Now, if we were to take this at face value, we would think it means ""Listen to all authority no matter what."" However: this would actually contradict St. Paul's actions. 

Because according to other parts of scripture such as Acts 22:24-29, Paul himself used the laws of the Romans to get him out of a situation. In which a centurion was ordering for a scourging. Paul basically asked ""Is it lawful to scourge a Roman citizen uncondemned?"" The centurion asked ""Are you a Roman citizen?"" Paul replies ""Yes, I was born a Roman Citizen!""

And even more in scripture such as Numbers it says the daughters of Zelophehad were unable to inherit land according to the law God gave. So Moses went to God and said ""They say this law is unfair, but this Is the law you gave me."" God actually acknowledges their arguement and says ""change the law so they may be able to inherit it.""

Even more: in other parts such as Acts (again) when St. Peter, the leader of the apostles, was given the same vision 3 times where God said ""Peter, stand and kill the animals."" They were all unclean under the law of Moses. And Peter didn't want to go against his conscience. God himself said ""do not call unclean to what is now clean."" 

Ezekiel, in which When God said to cook his food on human dung, said he couldn't under the law of Moses. Moses, who said he shouldn't be sent to preach to the Israelites since he couldn't speak well, and Abraham who said you couldn't destroy the city of Sodom and gammorah for their wickedness because that would go against God's conscience because there are innocent people in the cities (taking the number all the way from 50 to 10 people that are innocent cannot destroy the city.)

Last is the slave thing:

>Literally, slaves obey your master's tells the slaves to do so because material freedom on earth through violent force is irrelevant to eternal immaterial freedom in the afterlife through keeping your head down and praying

This is the same thing as what St. Paul meant in Romans 13.

And even more Yeshua (LHBP) even said ""whoever must be great among you must be your servant and whoever be versed among you must be your slave."" So by definition, this means that ALL are slaves and even more: they're set free according to Luke 4:18-21

And even more: If we were to go to Engels' definition of Socialism, atleast the utopian version had NAMED the early Christian church as proto-socialism (atleast before scientific socialism) or how we would know: Utopian socialism.

To be fair though, what I was referring to (presbyterian polity) does delegate some power upwards, in the form of Presbyteries/Classis, and in some cases Synods and/or General Assemblies, for larger denominations. In Dutch Reformed churches, these are delegated bodies, which do not exist in-between meetings. In the US, they are typically a permanent body. How much power these bodies can exercise vary, but it is usually rather limited. 

In other words, there are hierarchies at play, though they are far more limited and horizontal than what we see in contemporary western governments, private enterprises and even most large labour unions. Sure, if your criteria for religion being acceptable is that all of it is organised like some utopian anarchist commune, there will be rather few churches which achieve that bar. But how things stand, most traditional (Reformed) Protestant churches are organised much more horizontally than any of the other major power structures in today's society (once again, including most larger labour organisations), so I find it a little bit silly when it is implied that these organisations are more nefarious and/or authoritarian than the other major institutions.

Matthew 6:24 — “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”

Among very many other verses. 

The reason Christians can support both Christ’s teachings and Capitalism is simple: they very often only read the lines of the Bible that the preachers teach. The preachers may be more concerned with changing an individual’s outlook on life compared to challenging the ideological superstructure (which is fair, you aren’t gonna be able to do that in a single mass). 

Further, many Evangelical Christians think that Christ was simply wrong about the sermon on the mount. I’ve heard testimony from preachers saying that church attendants asked why they were preaching liberal ideas: 

>[Moore left the Southern Baptist Church when it swerved hard right. Hartman quoted what Moore said to a National Public Radio interviewer after “multiple pastors” had told him “about quoting the Sermon on the Mount, parenthetically, in their preaching — ‘turn the other cheek’ — to have someone come up after to say, ‘Where did you get those liberal talking points?’ And what was alarming to me is that in most of these scenarios, when the pastor would say, ‘I’m literally quoting Jesus Christ,’ the response would not be, ‘I apologize.’ The response would be, ‘Yes, but that doesn’t work anymore. That’s weak.’ And when we get to the point where the teachings of Jesus himself are seen as subversive to us, then we’re in a crisis.”](https://amp.kentucky.com/opinion/op-ed/article278563349.html)

Belief: This is between you and the universe, it is how you make sense of the world and can, at least with current technology, only be experienced by you. This is your individual journey.

Religion: This is what we create together. I think any shared beliefs of the world is a religion and all of us are part of many of these shared beliefs. This is inherently a shared journey.

Rituals: This is how we express our personal or shared beliefs. Some can be very structured like it is the case in Christianity but most of them are not nearly as complicated. Every morning I wake up, make myself a cup of the same green tea and meditate until the cup is empty. Just a small ritual that embodies my beliefs of how I should live my life. Habitats I picked up by being in circles of people that also believe and practices this.

I believe that it is important to make these distinctions as I see it at the core of the problem you describe. It is when personal belief, shared belief and rituals is perceived at one that we struggle to empathize with the individual and shared struggle their beliefs and rituals create for them.

I believe change comes from understanding others. Only when we can relate will we be able to set aside the differences and stand together for the things we share.

> “**The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man.** Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. **The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.**

> Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

> **The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.** The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.

> **Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower.** The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.

> **It is, therefore, the task of history, once the other-world of truth has vanished, to establish the truth of this world.** It is the immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, to unmask self-estrangement in its unholy forms once the holy form of human self-estrangement has been unmasked. **Thus, the criticism of Heaven turns into the criticism of Earth, the criticism of religion into the criticism of law, and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.**”",/r/socialism/comments/16we0ko/why_socialists_should_not_be_antireligious/k2xti01/,1696121566.0,r/socialism,0.46551725,0,True,2023-10-16_0412

k2x4xy2,ctlattube,f7s6bw1,"The only thing I agree with you on is the fact that communist should not coerce people to be 'atheists'. But no amount of mental gymnastics is enough to envision an ideal where socialism and religion are compatible. Religion is deterministic and idealistic, it stands in complete contrast to dialectical materialism. 

Even if you were to argue that it's organised religion which is the class enemy and not individual beliefs, it's still impossible to separate the two, since centuries of organised religion have moulded your cultural practices today, which are more often that not paternalistic and advocate against the interests of sexual minorities. We cannot assume these groups to be a necessary collateral damage just so religion and socialism can co-exist, because nothing short of total acceptance of these communities by religious organizations can be accepted. Your own 'interpretations' and 'definitions' of your religion do not matter if more than a substantial proportion of adherents do not subscribe to your personal beliefs. 

The claim that these two can be reconciled is revisionist at its core. And it's evident in the fact that you mention buddhist socialists who advocate non-violence. Having been a part of socialist dalit circles in India where a majority are buddhists or sympathetic to the religion, many agree with theory when it comes to the violent nature of class struggle, the idea that we can somehow bring a revolution without the use of violence is naive and an idea that has been warned against many times by revolutionaries who've actually been successful. 

In the end, religion has evolved as a tool to uphold the status quo, it is simply not feasible to reform Christianity and Islam which are defined by their organised nature, and while we should not be against the inclusion of religious people within the struggle, we should remember the roots of religion and how it continues to work in deterring class struggle.

This way, we can reduce the potential for conflict and instability, and promote our own agenda more effectively.
An example of this strategy is how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has managed to co-opt some of the Buddhist and Taoist organizations in China. The CCP has appointed its own officials as the heads of these organizations, and has used them to promote patriotism, socialism, and harmony among the people.

Marx recognizes that the majority of workers are dominated by bourgeois ideology, after all “the ideas of the ruling class are the ruling ideas” so of course he is addressing the proletarian vanguard.

He meant opiates as a palliative for suffering.

What people choose to believe in or do in their own time outside of politics should be their business and their business alone, so long as it's not hurting others, discriminating against specific groups, or spreading dangerous misinformation about politics or public health.

I also agree that many socialist states have made the mistake of trying to outlaw religion. Religion isn't going away any time soon, and trying to ban personal beliefs/practices is as pointless as trying to ban people from having thoughts or ideas. But regulating religious institutions isn't out of the question if they become powerful and dangerous. Theocracy is just as bad as autocracy.

I think that churches should be barred from getting involved in politics via financial donations/lobbying, especially if they don't pay taxes.

Thinking of Religious liberation theory for example, or just Muslims who is and were doing forms of socialism and communism. Also, is that the arguement? Wah, religion does bad things? Are you not tired of the 'Communism has always failed' arguements or 'communism murders people' nonsense? It's the same boring arguement that ignores any complexity or interest in being fair.

I'll take the socialism where I can get it, and I'm absolutely going to support religious people who interpret their religion in ways that support socialist ideals. You can critique the harmful shit but when you're confronted with a religious person who agrees with you and is pushing for socialist stuff, you just look like silly going 'oh well your ideology murders people'. Like me going to you and saying 'oh well your ideology leads starvation and death' and when you go 'okay well i don't want to starve people actually', I go 'okay maybe that's how you personally feel, but a government formed from your ideology always leads to starvation' and lol.

k2xqqp4,RoboticsNinja1676,3t9qon99,"When Marx said religion was the ‘opium of the masses’, he didn’t necessarily mean that as a bad thing. In fact, he likened it to opium’s medicinal qualities as a painkiller, giving people hope that after a life of misery, exploitation, and suffering, they could find peace, happiness and serenity in the next. As an atheist, I 100% agree with this analysis, and though I still hope the human species will one day move past the need for religion, I am 100% in agreement that socialist should not be aggressively opposed to religious people.

The period of time after I first came to the realization that there is no afterlife and that after I die I would cease to exist was one of the most agonizing periods of my life. Being from a comfortable enough middle class background, I can’t fathom going through what I did if I was in a far worse socioeconomic situation. There is a reason that people from lower socioeconomic strata tend to also be the most deeply pious. 

Many people truly NEED religion to survive or they would lose all purpose in their life, and this is especially true for many of the most oppressed people in society. It gives a large number of people meaning and given how tempting it is to believe in a benevolent god and an eternity in heaven/paradise/Elysium with all your loved ones, I cannot blame them for doing so.

It is for this reason that I 100% agree that socialism should not be aggressively anti-theist. While I am personally opposed to religion and spirituality and find them to be wholly unscientific, I understand that there are so many people who simply cannot function at all without it. As long as said beliefs are not bigoted or cultish, I am a strong believer in religious freedom being a cornerstone of the socialist movement. 

I will say though that just as I am opposed to aggressively anti-theist tendencies in socialism, that I am just as opposed to explicitly religious forms of socialism too. Socialism should be a secular movement and explicitly religious brands socialism tend to get real reactionary real quick. It also projects modern socialist beliefs onto figures that lived thousands of years ago, such as Buddha and Jesus, whom socialism would have been completely alien to. People should think of themselves more as socialists who happen to be theists/atheists rather than explicitly theistic/atheistic socialists.",/r/socialism/comments/16we0ko/why_socialists_should_not_be_antireligious/k2xqqp4/,1696120429.0,r/socialism,0.8681253,1,True,2023-10-16_0412

Most large religions are used as tools for fascism. There are religions, of course, that don't do this, but you'd have to find a way to distinguish between the traits of a religion that creates cult mentalities and those that don't.

k34xa47,RegularSizedJones,djl0vgrws,"I'm an atheist and personally strongly anti-religion, but I think the OP makes some very important and relevant historical points about the reality of praxis vs higher-minded anti-hierarchical or anti-hegemonical theory about organizing.

Religious movements can be used to liberate or oppress, because religion is a technology like any other tool. If you're a socialist and religious, you connect those two; just as you would if you were a capitalist and religious (see Protestantism, et al).

Ethiopia is a great example of how not to organize a religious people. A more striking one is Afghanistan. The edict from the PDPA banning the burqa ended up being the catalyst that began the mujahid counter-revolution which destroyed the country and spawned Al-Qaeda.

If socialism is about liberation, and organizing is about meeting people where they are, we have to understand that ""liberation"" is not universally defined across all people. When the PDPA banned the burqa, the practical outcome outside major, secular cities would have been a total house arrest for religious Afghani women. For them, freedom to wear the burqa was more than symbolic.

The way to challenge existing hierarchies and hegemonies is to provide a better working model. History shows that religions will adapt themselves to prevailing social opinion much more quickly than an entire population will reject religion based on religious conflict with that prevailing opinion. The texts get reinterpreted when they need to be so the service religious institutions provide will remain relevant.",/r/socialism/comments/16we0ko/why_socialists_should_not_be_antireligious/k34xa47/,1696252676.0,r/socialism,0.7466812,1,True,2023-10-16_0412

In 1936 there was an Arab uprising against Britain to stop Jews settling in MP

Israel declared independence of their part on the 14th May 1948 after the UK pulled out of Mandatory Palestine 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence

However the Palestinians would not accept this partition plan and with the help of the Arab League neighbours invaded and attempted to wipe out all the Jews to take the whole land also on the 14th May 1948

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War

Then in 1956 we get the Suez crisis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis



Then they tried again to destroy Israel  in 1967 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War

They failed so started a War of Attrition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Attrition 

and 73 when they performed a surprise attacked on Yom Kippur 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War


After this there were several attempts at a peace process over several decades

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_peace_process

In 1987 you had the first Intifada 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada

In 1990 you had Black Monday at the Temple Mount

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Temple_Mount_killings

In 2005 you had the second intifada 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada

This lead to the election win of Ariel Sharon (an Ex IDF General nicknamed the Butcher of Beirut) who implemented the complete disengagement with Gaza, the situation we have today, where all Jews were forcibly removed from the Gaza Strip by the IDF and Gaza were given full autonomy 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza

Soon after the complete withdrawal, rockets were shot into Israel, and a Hamas pickup truck in the Jabaliya refugee camp exploded, killing at least 19 people (both militants and civilians) and injuring 85 people.

Then there were elections and Gaza elected Hamas (an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood) on a policy of destroying the state of Israel and “strives to raise the banner of Allah  over  every  inch  of Palestine” by removing all Jews from the whole land of Israel-Palestine  from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election

After this Hamas and Fatah (another Palestinian political party who won in the West Bank who are in the PLO umbrella, unlike Hamas) has a disagreement 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah-Hamas_conflict


After all of Hamas’ continued attacks Egypt and Israel implemented a blockade of the Gaza Strip

* Opinion polls over last few years have indicated that if there was an election in Palestine, Hamas would be the single largest party

>“It feels like the government abandoned us not only on this Saturday but before that. Because forces… were sent to the West Bank, forces that would have been vital in defending the [south of Israel], defending the people who live there.

It seems like there are three separate incidents of explosions on the evacuation roads. For two, whilst there isn’t conclusive evidence 

>Chris Cobb-Smith, a former British army major and weapons and munitions expert, said that while it was hard to draw a definitive conclusion, the available evidence suggested the most likely cause of the blast was a missile strike

The third, which is the one that the video is being shared of so there is more conclusive evidence:

>On Sunday, in a briefing broadcast on X, formerly Twitter, he played a video of a different explosion two miles south on Salah-ad-Din street. He said the IDF was not responsible for this attack — which he suggested was more likely to be from a roadside IED — but did not mention the blasts documented in the videos verified by the FT

One is very likely a domestic explosion, either a roadside IED or just a propane tank explosion or something. Two are very possibly Israeli missile strikes. These latter are the ones that other organisations like the BBC have been talking about (because the video location is completely different to the one people are using to say roadside explosion)

The western campaign against ISIS was basically to hit them hard enough that all their neighbours who were already fighting them (which was everyone) could have an easier time of it.

Whereas the current air campaign by the Israeli Air Force is specifically to create the conditions for a ground assault into prepared positions.

The problem of course is that doing that mission in a city rather than a desert is significantly worse a prospect. Especially as any building can be made into a strongpoint if you smash the windows, knock some loopholes into the walls and have a few sandbags handy.

There's a very big reason why Israel has basically just accepted a few deaths here and there from rockets that got past Iron Dome without trying to do anything permanent about Hamas.

k4u8bbz,wishbeaunash,rlifg,"Understandably a lot of the focus has been on the expected civilian casualties if, as looks likely, Israel conduct a ground offensive against Gaza city(and if their aim is to actually occupy the city and defeat Hamas), but I've not seen much discussion on what the potential Israeli casualties of such an operation would be? 

It's easy to assume that because they have such an advantage in terms of firepower that it would be a straightforward thing to do but recent experiences in Syria would suggest this isn't the case. 

Urban warfare is incredibly difficult and bloody even when the attacker has an overwhelming advantage of weaponry and numbers, particularly when fighting a fanatical enemy willing to fight to the death. And in cases like Raqqa and Aleppo the US and Russia were able to rely on having large numbers of (to put it bluntly) politically expendable troops to do most of the actual fighting in the form of the Syrian military and allied militias, and the SDF. Israel does not have this option. Every causality taken in Gaza will be another death added to the already staggering toll Israel has suffered in the past week, something I'm sure Hamas will be all too aware of.

Previous urban battles in Syria also often came at the end of months-long campaigns to wear down the enemy by which time the US and Russia likely had extensive intelligence on what they were facing. Based on the failure to prevent the initial Hamas assault, Israeli intelligence on what's happening in Gaza would seem to be surprisingly poor.

Perhaps I'm overlooking something, but in my (admittedly completely worthless) view it seems like another recipe for disaster. What will the tolerance be among the Israeli public for further losses? Perhaps after the shock of the massacre, the answer is 'whatever it takes to defeat Hamas', but it also seems like there's a risk that the government is seen as following one bloody catastrophe with another if they're not careful.",/r/ukpolitics/comments/176u3oq/international_politics_discussion_thread/k4u8bbz/,1697289209.0,r/ukpolitics,0.9728239,1,True,2023-10-16_0412
k4udqen,SporkofVengeance,j4x7a,"It's hard to tell at this stage. However, unlike Hezbollah in Lebanon, the area is already effectively encircled and just going off the number of fighters Israel has claimed to have killed so far on the Israel side of the wall – something like 1500 several days ago – plus those probably dead in air strikes suggests Hamas has already incurred substantial losses. 

In contrast to the American sieges of Fallujah and Sadr City after the Iraq War, Hamas will have less cover because large chunks of the city are now rubble (though this makes it harder to get around in wheeled vehicles).

The bigger problem is securing any substantial part of the main city for any period of time when you've got a large network of tunnels let alone the logistics of maintaining such a large area with almost zero cooperation from anyone there. Unless the Israels find a way to build cooperation it will be a long war of attrition.

k4oq4qi,PositivelyAcademical,1vpp3xkk,"It’s probably worth pointing out that the Vesuvius Red Zone has a 9 mile radius. The evacuation plan is in three phases: 12 hours organisation, 48 hours removal, and 12 hours contingency. The plan is for local government to physically evacuate people from designated waiting points in the red zone to designated meeting points in the yellow zone, with the evacuation happening only via designated ‘gates’ between the zones. I.e. the plan requires 12 hours to mobilise personnel from local government within and just beyond the red and yellow zones, and to place roadblocks at the red–yellow zone border. The 48 hours is for local government to collect and bus people across that border. The plan doesn’t rely on self-help by the local population (i.e. we will come and get you, you do not attempt to make your own way out).

North Gaza is about (I had to eyeball it) 4 miles in length (running parallel to the coast). I don’t think anyone is expecting Hamas to organise any part of it; so for most people it will be a self-help evacuation. 4 miles over rough terrain can be walked in 2-3 hours; some people will get left behind if they can’t physically make the journey themselves. But the unfortunate reality of war is that Israel only needs to attempt to minimise civilian casualties, not guarantee a 100% successful evacuation.

Rightly or wrongly, Cameron was seen as a change candidate when against Brown (who was tainted by the financial crisis), then a much more statesmanlike PM than Ed Miliband in 2015. That's all their is to it. It's the same reason why Corbyn lost twice, people just thought he was strange. It's also the main reason why (at the moment) Starmer looks like winning next time, the average bloke on the street can imagine him as PM, imagine him on the world stage and not be embarassed.

Well, the money is gone, interest rates are up with no sign of going back to zero, and Boomers are retiring en mass with the expectation of being able to take cruises every couple of months for the rest of their lives on their pensions.

There is no longer enough money to pay off the Boomers *and* think about the future. And this was entirely predictable and has been predicted for decades. Everyone who took a serious look at Western finances could tell that without a miracle they'd break down around now, but democracy made it impossible to tell Boomers they weren't going get all the free stuff they were promised.

Nope. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Bank-Rate.asp

Interest rates have been at or below 1% since Feb 2009. Before that, it was 5-7%.

The Boomers are the first and only generation to take more from the state than pay in taxes. They're going to have to suffer some difficult years as social costs will not get paid by the state. Remember the ""Dementia tax""? Hugely unpopular with Tory voters but its coming.

>Besides which, at first glance it seems daft to be spending billions and billions of pounds building railway lines to let people travel faster when fewer and fewer people actually need to travel.

This is incorrect. Infrastructure spending is almost always a good thing for the economy. The only time it isn't good, is when there's too much. Building one bridge over a river is great. People spend less time crossing and can do more work or go to new places and spend more money. Building 100 is excessive and the cost benefits are tiny for each new bridge. 

>Yes, but you're not going to get one through late-stage democracy. We're heading into Aristotle's 'democracy degenerates into tyranny' stage right now.

No we aren't. This is very similar to the end stages of the Thatcher/Major years. They ran the economy down and destroyed the fiscal markets. Then, under Labour, things got better (if you ignore all the torture and wars and authoritarian bits, which most Brits do). Democracy didn't die with Major's multiple scandals.

k3i8uub,Jademalo,5ab0u,"It's a tricky one, because it was arguably the right move to make at the time. Railways were in decline with no real sign of things turning around, and the APT project was a *steal* at the budget. There was a [1981 press release](https://www.apt-p.com/PR198111.htm) that really highlighted how little we spent, about £40m compared to the french £800m, and in testing the APT-P could hit 250km/h on the existing lines compared to LGV Sud-Est's 300km/h.

The other annoying part of this is that the APT project was pretty successful, and the majority of the design goals were achieved. However due to prototype reliability issues and a particularly bad press event, the media turned on the project and there was no way to win in the court of public opinion. One of my favourite anecdotes though is that one of the reasons for the nausea in the early prototypes was that it worked *too well*, and the tilt completely counteracted the lateral force of corners. When you looked out of the window and the force you're experiencing didn't match the visuals outside, you felt sick. The solution was to tilt the cars ever so slightly less, so you still felt the corners just a little bit.

The ultimate irony is that the descendants of that tech are running on railways [all over the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendolino). Thatcher sold the patent to Fiat, then they sold it back to us as a product a decade later.

Capacity is ultimately the big one, back then we were more bothered about speed than capacity due to the general usage of the railways and the size of the country. Plenty of our lines can run pretty fast, there's a section of the ECML that can pretty handily do 250km/h. As the network has become clogged though that speed hasn't been relevant, so track work and signalling never caught up.

What sucks though is it was clearly the wrong choice in hindsight, but that's 50 years worth of a changing world. The real mistake though was not realising that in the 90s when HS1 and the Chunnel were first being developed, and just limping along for 30 more years.",/r/ukpolitics/comments/16zpamp/david_cameron_todays_decision_on_hs2_is_the_wrong/k3i8uub/,1696464299.0,r/ukpolitics,0.5927706,1,True,2023-10-16_0412

The North Sea oilfields are split down the middle and therefore Norway and the UK have extracted roughly the same amount of North Sea oil and gas as each other over the past half century.

However, the UK's population is more than twelve times greater than that of Norway.

Money certainly goes a lot further when you have an order of magnitude more of it to spend per head.

Second of all while I understand that the UK has a bigger population, think about having the $143 billion return Norway had in just 6 months! That's 280 billion in ONE year... just money coming in off the investments made from the oil money.

The campaign for Brexit ran on ""saving 350 million a week"" which would be £18 billion a year that is easily covered by how much money an oil fund could have netted the UK. Are you telling me that's insignificant money because the UK has 12x the population of Norway?

It's hard to calculate the economic activity and bump in GDP certain infrastructure projects have since direct correlation is not easy to infer. However there is a general consensus that good infrastructure that makes connections more efficient is always a win long term.

&#x200B;

The more a nation gives up on certain projects because of just cost, the more it handicaps itself and has a bigger uphill to climb: something that I am genuinely sad about on behalf of the UK. I am not putting forward this opinion to denigrate, but to lament the choices made.

Just think, the cost for HSR2... like all of the cost, all of it, for the whole project: was estimated to £100 billion. Imagine that, it's less than Norway made for the first 6 months of this year by just investing their oil money back in the day.

k3julqo,Stralau,12ke2t,"Each to their own, of course. I think Cameron *significantly* decreased honesty in politics with a number of outright lies to the public - notably during the AV referendum and during the 2015 election campaign- , his use of referendums did permanent damage to the UK constitution, and his austerity policies failed even on their own terms: unlike Germany, say, he didn't reduce public spending or the deficit by much, he broadly followed Milliband's trajectory.

He unleashed Johnson and Truss, due to a completely unforced referendum. Johnson is just the scorpion in this scenario, Cameron is the Frog, and it's the Frog that bears the main responsibility imo.

Apart from the Brexit campaign, and his predictable but still egregious incompetence and behaviour in office, I don't think Johnson changed the direction of the country much. We can't really say that Covid would have been handled significantly differently by a different government. No parties, maybe, but lockdowns and vaccine rollout would have been the same. I don't think we can be sure that a different government would have locked down earlier, say, even if it's satisfying to blame Johnson for it.

Truss is a joke, and did a lot of damage in the short time she was there, but there's only so much you can do in the length of time she was in office.

Cameron was in office for over five years. I can think  of nothing that he improved (*maybe* the quotient of renewable energy in the UK energy mix?

As an example, the m4 relief road which is hugely required in South Wales was scrapped time and time again. 

The m4 comes to a halt every time you get near newport and is no doubt a bigger barrier to economic progression than the tolls on the bridge were. 

Yet look at the history of the thing, first proposed in 1991 but rejected by the UK government.in 1999  powers were devolved so Wales could make the decision and 6 years later the project was proposed again as part of a 15 year plan. Fast forward to 2009 (5 years into the 15 year plan) and the project was stopped for the same reason HS2 beyond Birmingham has been rejected, costs had risen £600m to £1bn. The reason the costs went so high in 5 years? Inflation and the Twaite Shad fish and the need to protect it. Instead, they decided to do upgrades to existing infrastructure, just like now. 

They talk and talk and talk more and in 2015 the road now apparently costs well below £1bn.  A year later of more reports and documents, the cost is now £1.1bn and it was included in labour's manifesto to build. More and more reports and recommendations were ordered with a target to open the road Autumn 2021. More public enquiries and talk causes any possible opening of being December 2023 and now the cost is £1.4bn. The removal of the severn bridge tolls massively increase pressure on the road but in 2018 the supportive welsh minister steps down leaving mark drakeford to make the decision, who scrapped it in 2019. 

Just like HS2, people's homes were bought and people were displaced all for nothing. In 2009 the world was struggling just like today with HS2 and its easy at this moment to kick the can down the road. But change in leadership happens and this changes the direction of long term plans. Long term plans should be taken out of the hands of politicians. There should be an infrastructure bank, separate to the decisions of politicians. Schemes written into law which future governments are bounded by. Money pumped into it as a commitment like the 2% commitment on  defence. Long term plans cannot be succumbed to the whim of short term politicians.",/r/ukpolitics/comments/16zpamp/david_cameron_todays_decision_on_hs2_is_the_wrong/k3h5k7t/,1696449600.0,r/ukpolitics,0.5212185,1,True,2023-10-16_0412

There was a court case a few years ago (the David Miranda one) where the Government had to concede that ""fire-fighters threatening to go on strike"" met the Terrorism Act definition of terrorists (it was topical when the hearings where happening). With such a broad definition the choice of which groups get proscribed is a political one.

The Taliban trying to overrun a US base isn't a terrorist attack because there was an actual military objective behind it, but the same group blowing up civilians in Kabul is 100% a terrorist attack since the only goal is to spread terror. But what about a roadside bomb killing military contractors?

An ISIS suicide bomber attacking civilians in a European country is very obviously a terrorist attack, since it doesn't achieve anything beyond scaring other civilians and maybe inspiring more terrorist attacks. But when you get to a complicated conflict like Myanmar or Syria with an oppressive regime vs an assortment of more and less radical groups, deciding who is a 'terrorist group' and which actions count as a 'terrorist attack' becomes subjective.

Legal definitions also don't necessarily make sense. For example, the US has designated the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organisation.

You cannot seriously be this naïve? Integration for immigrants from third world countries is incredibly difficult, they haven't had anywhere near the education, healthcare (especially dental) or upbringing someone from a developed country has.  They often come from incredibly different cultures, some with very regressive views, often compounded by religious beliefs.

How on earth do you think that unskilled individuals with very low levels of education are going to be massive contributors to the country overall?

Yes, cultures change. That's such a weak statement as to be completely worthless. No one expects or is arguing that or believes that a culture remains exactly for the same for 1000 years. Anyone who replies with ""cultures are always changing, duh"" is attacking a strawman.

There's clearly different degrees of change, and the tipping point of at what point does the change become so great it becomes something else entirely is a fair concern.

>it sounds ridiculous right off the bat for their (white) kid to place himself as part of the Chinese people. It will be much more difficult, even impossible, to become part of the Chinese ethnic group

You're making a weird distinction here where being part of a given ethnic group is some sort of necessity or prerequisite to being accepted and integrated into that culture. This is not the case. Integration is not predicated on being absorbed into a singular ethnic identity. You can be ""white"" whatever and still live together with other ethnic groups well, and hell even consider yourself as first and foremost part of that country over your parents/your own motherland.

I can show you people who fit this exact hypothetical you've suggested of the ""white British kid"" who are well regarded by Chinese people and who consider themselves to be well integrated with that society and culture to the extent of feeling ""Chinese"".

We live in a globalised, technologically-focused society where you can call someone the other side of the world in a couple of seconds. You don't need to be a physical melting-pot of various, disparate cultures and peoples (who often have key incompatibilities that results in friction, from an ideological perspective) to to reap the benefits of 'diversity' and 'multiculturalism'. 

Areas of Sweden such as Malmo have, demonstrably, seen their sexual harassment and assault statistics go through the roof directly off-the-back of importation/immigration from third-world/developing nations (who, nearly always, are men). They've released all sorts of comms/educational advice to said immigrations about how to...y'know, not do those things, which I'm sure is a massive consolation to the native Swedish girls and women who have been assaulted. Telling these people that they're naughty boys and giving them a slap on the wrist for bad behaviour is completely backwards. 

It's like inviting the wolf into your home and then giving it a beating because it proceeds to maul your cat just minutes after being let inside.

k2f3fdg,JakeArcher39,te3ia,">So what is the definition of British culture? I am not being obtuse, I am actually really interested in how people define it.

You can't just define it in a sentence like a word in the dictionary. The previous comment is bang on - basically every cultural is undefinable in a single, cohesive sentence or two.

Nobody would deny, for example, that Italian culture is distinct, and definitely exists...but try to actually define it. For most people, it would be, more-or-less: ""Pizza and Pasta, red wine, Ancient Rome, football, people using lots of hand gestures when talking, beautiful art and architecture, Leonardo Da Vinci, The Renaissance, close family ties, etc"". Individually, most of those things mean very little, and they're certainly not 'a culture' in isolation. Indeed, they could even be seen as stereotypes, to a degree. But that's sort of the point. Which is why it sounds weird when you try and define/describe it in literal, concrete terms. 

If you did the same for Britain, it'd probably be something like: ""British Empire, WW1 and WW2, Fish and Chips, beer/ale, The Beatles, King Henry VIII, Battle of Hastings, London, the countryside, Roast Dinner, Magna Carta, Rule of Law, politeness and tolerance, railway transport, etc).

Think about the order of events here and the timing.

If I supported a movement, and then that movement was involved in something like this, surely if you had a nuanced view on this you’d recognise that this is bad, and shut the fuck up for a few days at least?

So why did these people choose to come out in support when they did? People don’t do things for _no_ reason. I saw a bunch of people on Facebook/nextdoor app immediately rallying to show support after the attacks, and a lot of these people very clearly don’t actually even understand the conflict themselves. A lot of these people were Caucasian British. A lot of them just immediately accused anyone pointing out this is not a good situation and Hamas have made it worse as being racist. These people do not do nuance. I guess this is an outlet that allows some of them to virtue signal and express view about the world that would otherwise be treated as deeply warped and problematic. People with problems have an outlet with things like this.

A lot of them are barely literate and this is a purely emotional thing for them, and many are very clearly  caught up in deeply propagandised ideas about the world and this conflict. Many don’t actually care to understand it. Hamas is a self identified Marxist/radical socialist group, and so there seems to be a lot of overlap with the extreme left in the UK as a result. So many in the UK will look past the reality of this situation because they’ve tied themselves to it and they’re on the “same team” ideologically so feel compelled to support them.

Groceries in the US have gotten really weird where processed foods are higher than it is in Canada, but heavily subsidized industries like dairy and agriculture are lower. 

So milk, eggs, and meat is generally cheaper, but anything else is more expensive. 

But not all markets are equal in the US because there are food deserts all over america where people only have access to ""Dollar General"" rather then an actual grocery store. So the prices for poor people are higher.  It used to be the other way around where the cost of process foods was really low in the US. 

Canada's food prices while has gone up, is more stable than it is in a lot of US states. 

There are a lot of goods in the US that are actually more expensive than in canada. 

For instance, a lot of car youtubers are saying, this car is actually cheaper in Canada then it is in the US with the exchange rate.

The misinformation is coming from conservatives who don't want to admit their party is doing these things.

Lol.

The person I replied to said tried to ""preempt misinformation"" by posting misinformation.

I'm under no illusion that I'd convince the people commenting in these threads to vote Liberal, nor would I try to do that. Pretty well all the top comments I have tags on so I can avoid engaging with them, you included (for your copypastas).

All I'm doing is countering their misinformation.

Normally I'd quote some article to prove every point, but I didn't feel the need to quote [C-311](https://www.arcc-cdac.ca/media/six-reasons-oppose-bill-c-311.pdf) and go on about how no womens rights groups or pro-choice groups would ever endorse the bill and it was only supported by Conservatives and anti-choice/christian groups.

Similarly I didn't feel the need to quote the various ""parental rights"" bills that directly conflict with basic Humans rights, Child rights and LGBT rights.

That seems like common knowledge to me, but I read news, unlike (seemingly) most of this sub.

I did feel the need to quote the article of Bergen with the MAGA hat though, just because that's pretty egregious, and a great example of ""Trumpism"" in the Conservative party.

Remember when she was interim party leader? I do.

I'm open to hearing an argument about how this is misinformation, but you'd need to prove that C-311 isn't an anti-choice bill despite it clearly being one, and you'd need to prove that the ""parental rights"" bills that Conservative Premiers are introducing, and Poilievre is supporting, aren't going to do the thing they explicitly want to do, which good luck, considering Sask had to use the NWC preemptively.",/r/canada/comments/178m351/338canada_federal_projection_cpc_194_lpc_90_bq_32/k51n3ff/,1697412468.0,r/canada,0.8466005,1,True,2023-10-16_0412

They could always stop introducing bills every couple years to convince people otherwise.

>No, the Conservatives aren't going to flood the streets with bazookas by repealing all gun laws.

I'll give you that. If a party runs on loosening firearm restriction, they'll lose the election.

>No, the Conservatives aren't going to bring in ""Trumpism"", whatever the fuck that even means.

They could stop following the lead of Americans with things like ""parental rights"". ""Justinflation"" conveniently sounds like ""Bidenflation"", but that's probably a coincidence... I could make compare Republicans to Conservatives all day. They should stop trying to ""Take back Canada"" and make Canada the ""Freest country on earth"" if they don't want people to think they're importing American politics.

k31749o,DavidBrooker,70zvzlk0,"What's remarkable about the M2, and what is significantly responsible for its longevity, is that, even though the first designs came out in the 19-teens, its been more or less continuously developed: the latest design iteration came about in 2010, which removed (among other things) the adjustable headspace. And the versions most people think of are the air cooled variants that came about in the 30s (whereas the earlier versions were water cooled - as an aside, seeing the 2022 version of *Im Westen Nichts Neues* recently, I appreciated seeing the cooling water basins, which were prerequisite in the era). If the modern designs we've used tried to replace the M2 of 1919 or 1933, it wouldn't have been a competition at all, the new designs would have vastly outperformed the thing - but new designs have failed to replace the *latest* variants, not the *earliest*. Its not like it came out of the first drawing the perfect gun, or something (to respond to 'just that good')

(As an example, the adjustable headspace in the M2 was originally a design *compromise*: the quality of the mass manufacturing technology a century ago more or less demanded adjustable headspace. You could make a reliable weapon with a fixed headspace given the time to machine every part, in a small production run, but that was just not possible in large-scale production, because the technology on assembly lines meant there was too much part-to-part variation. But modern manufacturing can do away with it, and yet for a long time the M2 was the *only* American infantry weapon with an adjustable headspace, which caused reliability issues not to the design per se, but due to the limitations imposed on training - if its *every* weapon [which was pretty much the case in the 1920s], soldiers are familiar with the concept, but if its unique soldiers are more likely to make mistakes, so it had to be updated). 

There are analogies in other fields, like the Nikon 50/1.8 lens or the Chevy small block V8. Nikon's 50mm prime first came about in the 70s and has the unusual distinction of being both the cheapest *and* one of the highest optical quality lens Nikon makes, with compatibility on every Nikon f-mount camera from today all the way back to the 1960s, because they've spent 50 years working out every single kink. Seriously, slap a modern, 2023 vintage Nikon 50/1.8 onto a 1986 vintage AF Nikon film camera and it will work *perfectly*. Chevy's small-block, notionally obsolete with its OHV pushrod and rocker arm configuration, has been in continuous development for 70 years and designing a modern engine of similar performance, efficiency, reliability or compactness is an extremely tall order because - again - despite the technical limitations of its overall architecture (and those limitations are substantial) you have to overcome 70 years of small incremental adjustments working out every point of friction (in the functional design sense) that they could find. 

In many technological domains, a technologically superior design with a much higher absolute ceiling will have a hard time in the here and now beating decades of small iterative development, even if, given the same decades of iteration, the new design would likely carry you much further in some unseen future.",/r/canada/comments/16x42ex/utterly_repulsive_canadians_divided_on_justin/k31749o/,1696185347.0,r/canada,0.64506507,1,True,2023-10-16_0412
