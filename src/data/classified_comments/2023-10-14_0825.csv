I've talked to people who think that ANY amount of manipulation, by the media, by their party of choice, and by their candidate, is to be tolerated over trump. Look at this list of shit CNN has tried to pull this election:

1. [CNN would rather give you a sappy heartwarming LIE than admit this woman wants violence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8Cn6boqcA&feature=youtu.be)

2. [CNN and Anderson Cooper lie about past reporting they've done, and pretend that audio of Hillary cackling on about a child rape case is somehow ""not authenticated""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpwPwhvabi8&feature=youtu.be)

3. [Here's CNN's Don Lemon doing the god damned EXACT SAME THING.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?)

4. [Here's CNN pretending that looking at Wikileaks is illegal... But it's ok for them to do it... because they're the media...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg)

5. [Here's CNN coaching their ""focus group"" on what to say after the debate... because FUCK THE TRUTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI)

6. [CNN doesn't want to tell us what Trump *actually said*, so they'll just doctor his tweets and make shit up. No big deal right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Eps97Mp_s)
7. [It's always so unfortunate when technical issues cause cuts in feed every time someone say something bad about Hillary... especially when they were with Bernie till the end!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw)

8. [Of course they would employ Donna Brazile, head of the fucking DNC, who is happy to pass along debate questions to Hillary. At least until she got caught...](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-shared-additional-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign-identified-her-tipster/)

9. [And then the same thing happened for Wolf Blitzer.

Again, all this shit happened in the last 2 months, and this is from ONE ORGANIZATION.


So yea, the fact that CNN has any viewers left after this disgrace, along with the Daily Beast and Huffpo (Which employed convicted felon Bob Creamer who was just fired for widespread election fraud), is a testament to how much lying people are willing to tolerate and endorse... because Hillary Clinton must. just. be. that. damn. good.",/r/politics/comments/5blmi4/i_was_with_bernie_till_the_end_now_we_all_must/d9q9ru4/,1478560519.0,r/politics,0.9799728,1,True,2023-10-14_0825

They were terrified of a rule of the people because they realized that political power in the hands of the people would be a threat to their wealth and property- the people would clamor for an equitable distribution. The US has always been dominated by an oligarchy of capital. 

Madison:
The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge the wants or feelings of the day-laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe, — when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.

One faction of wealthy donors is intent on exacting revenge on the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust former speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to people familiar with the matter.

“They are total pieces of s---,” said Andy Sabin, a longtime Republican donor and metalworks executive. Sabin told CNBC he’s encouraging fellow donors not to give or raise money for members like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led the anti-McCarthy drive and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, a moderate who sided with hardliners against the California leader.

Another group of financiers want to take on Republicans who opposed the top candidate to replace McCarthy, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, these people explained.

“They’re angry. They’re all saying, ‘don’t give, don’t raise any money,’” a Republican fundraiser said.

There is a finite amount of money to spend on healthcare. Right now, the bulk of what is not overhead it is spent on those who pay for their insurance. When you extend this same finite amount of money to cover those who do not pay their way, there will not be enough. The quality and quantity both will suffer. And if you think replacing current insurance bureaucrats with the government ones will save money, you have not had enough experience with the government.

The rich will still get their 5 star healthcare by paying under the table to get the good doctors and to get around the lines. It's the middle class that will pay more and get less.

And as, I said, I both experienced socialized healthcare as a patient, I have/had 4 family members who worked in it as doctors.

I pretty much have all the choice I want. In my current job provided insurance I have to work hard to find an out of network physician, the result is an increase in co-pay, not an out of pocket payment. I really have no problems with it.

Medicare currently largely mooches off private insurance in that it frequently barely covers doctors' costs. This is why many don't take it. The ones that do make up for medicare with private insurance profits. You make everyone M4A and you will see a sharp decrease in both practicing doctors and quality of Med School applicants.

While data is obviously still coming in, it might be worthwhile to note that the situation might be less “your savings caused everyone else’s premiums to skyrocket” and more a case of “everyone’s premiums were going to skyrocket anyways, but because of the ACA yours didn’t”. [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071415/did-obamacare-make-premiums-go.asp).

Similarly while actual healthcare costs went up there’s a decent chance that was driven more by the fact that there are now more people insured (so more market demand) than the actual provisions of the ACA itself. [Source](https://ldi.upenn.edu/brief/effects-aca-health-care-cost-containment)

Well that's presuming that all Republicans are interested in actually not ceding power to and compromising with Democrats on every day that ends in Y.  Hint: That's not compromise, that's just slowly giving Democrats everything.

I wish they would, but it is not necessarily likely.

That's why we're without a speaker.  A few republicans were tired of that.  In that light, a powerless congress incapable of passing anything is better than a Democrat congress sometimes officiated by someone who happens to have an (R) behind their name.

They *are* in trouble, because many Republicans aren't really all that republican or conservative at all and willingly run along on that compromise treadmill without end, perfectly happy with starving to death.

An unfortunate thing that the people sick of the ""establishment"" or ""uniparty"" as some call it had to appear to ally with democrats.  I mean, it's obvious the Democrats wanted chaos and another chance at the seat, but that doesn't mean every vote had that same intent.

If they get it, it's because the establishment wills it, not the people who happened to vote with democrats to try to shake the Republicans out of that ""go along to get along, as long as the democrats don't falsely call me wasist any more"" weak mental state of surrender.

Whether they are belly up or just flat out Rino's, they're the reason the Republicans can't get it together.

For someone who was hired by Google to be a cloud software engineer, they were deemed only good enough for Community College.

Universities have declared war against Asians (since the late 2000's) and are openly discriminating against Asians, and it will take an act of law to make them reveal how they are hiring.

I spent way too many years in college (and most of that time teaching). I felt that I witnessed a collapse in standards in a very short period of time.

Just as one example, when I started as a student, if you cheated you would be either expelled entirely or fail the course. By the time I left academia (about 11 years later, same university), at worst the student would fail that one particular assignment/test. Also, I witnessed students make a Facebook group bitching about how about how difficult/unfair a test was (this was against a professor who was excellent at explaining the concepts, and was only slightly tougher than average). The University caved into the students and forced the professor to let them redo it.

In my opinion, college/university is now less about the academic disciplines, and more about creating an experience for the students (and wanting to retain them in the same way that any business wants to retain its customers).",/r/Conservative/comments/1771fyp/they_want_us_dead_how_are_you_allowing_this/k4qtqrq/,1697223831.0,r/Conservative,0.7897643,1,True,2023-10-14_0825

k4qvs7u,SiliconScarecrow,ia2ulgb0,"I will preface this with saying that I do not believe there is any real solution to this issue, and because of that I am terrified for what will occur during the next days and weeks.

Hamas rose to power 17 years ago in 2006, where they were elected with roughly 45% of the vote. They were elected to a term and no elections have occurred since. The median age in Gaza is 18, meaning that a majority of those in Gaza were one years old or not even born when Hamas came to power, and there are currently close to one million individuals ages 14 and younger out of the 2.3 million population.

What Hamas did is horrific on a scale that can not be met with anything but overwhelming force, but I fear what will now happen to the close million children being used as collateral. When food, water, and electricity is cut off those most vulnerable will die first, and they are predominantly the children. Ones who had no ability to leave Gaza and did not choose Hamas. On the other side Hamas's leadership is getting what they want while safely hidden away in other countries. They are hoping for martyrs and thousands dead because it will radicalize those left. 

So I don't know what the solution can be. There can be no negotiation with Hamas because this scenario is exactly what they want. There can be no simple turn of the other cheek because they will be emboldened and that spits on the memory of those who have died. There can be no prolonged embargo because hundreds of thousands of children will be starved to death. Gaza, at least independent Gaza, has failed as a concept, and I see no means by which it can be fixed. It will require enormous changes to how Gaza is run at all to be at all functional and not simply a breeding ground for radicalization. 

There is no solution. This conflict is one that will not end, and it will continue to grow worse.

k4rgfmf,superAL1394,4i1c1,"A nitpick, Hamas has been around since 1987. Their win over the PLO in 2006 was a shock to everyone.

As far as the solution, it's going to be ugly, tens of thousands will die, but I am pretty certain this is what Israel is going to do.

They are going to conquer Gaza. They are going to go building by building, room by room, and hunt down every member of Hamas they know about. They are going to search Gaza top to bottom for every rocket, rifle, and explosive they can find and destroy them. They will find the hostages still alive and rescue them, and recover the bodies of the dead. And they will find and destroy every piece of Hamas propaganda they can find.

When they finish, they will impose martial law then fund rebuilding Gaza with strict oversight from the IDF to ensure equipment and material actually goes where it is supposed to. Once Gaza is rebuilt, they will install a protectorate government. They will probably create a parliament of some kind for Gazan's but retain veto power over all legislation, enforce regular elections, and freely ban Islamist 'parties' from participating so the 2006 election doesn't happen again. They'll probably maintain direct control over certain government functions as well, like law enforcement, as well as close oversight on functions like education.

Ideally, after several decades of effective imperial government Gaza will be a prosperous place. Gazans who have only known Israel as a strict yet benevolent force in Gaza hopefully will no longer harbor the vitriolic and violent hatred. Disdain maybe, even resentment, but violent extremism is a vanishingly small minority. That is when they can consider giving Gaza complete sovereignty.

This, by the way, should've been our playbook for Afghanistan. But Bush haaaad to invade Iraq and we stretched ourselves thin. The added cost, casualties from Iraq, and being straight up lied to about WMD's is why the American public soured on Afghanistan imo. It got linked with Iraq in the public mind.

It's tough to find all of the instances over the years, but I snagged a few instances for you.  Remember this is a man who ran on ""unity"".

The attacks are directed at ""Maga Republicans"", which the left uses to describe anyone who supports Trump.  This was literally about 50% of the country vs Biden.  Unity.

Now put this in the context of weaponization of the DoJ and state AG's against political opponents, outspoken people on the the right, attorney's (which raises very serious legal issues).  Do you see how many people on the right think we're approaching a serious tipping point here, and take issue with the divisiveness this administration has repeatedly expressed?

fj0leyh,Chanimuadib,3k65oi1r,"Hello Tremold, thank you for the response. Your view of United States is not remotely accurate. Millions of people have doctor's appointments every day and we're not fucked. There are many cases where things in the health insurance industry are handled very appropriately. Ironically, I do perceive this to be primarily because of government intervention. There's far too many rules and regulations , it's way too complicated to go into detail but one example would be you cannot use health insurance across state lines. Health insurance companies have to create different plans for each different 50 states and this is due to government mandates.

When it comes to schools, I do agree with you, it's an absolute Nightmare and again some of this has to do with government regulation. But that's just for higher education me, I personally I'm not comfortable with the quality of Education from 5 year olds to 18 year olds either. But that is free but I don't necessarily like the quality oh, there is a lot of political bias in our education system now.

However, I think we have gotten to a point where ""business ethics"" are ruining many systems in our country. I know it won't be easy. I know there will be flaws to address. But I think it is time to consider a socialized version of healthcare and education. I think focus in the health and education of our citizens will reverb across our country in positive ways. These things can be done successfully. While I think capitalism certainly has benefits in areas... It is time to take the ""business"" out of healthcare and schools. Because honestly, you or I may be getting a great education or healthcare. And I understand the business nature of the medical field pushes all of the tech advances.

This is a significant “change election” and it is part of a generational political re-alignment that is going to sweep 1000 Republicans out of office, across the country, at all levels, over the next three elections 

AND THE 2024 CAMPAIGN NEEDS EXPRESS THAT

Positive celebration. Find a way to celebrate every positive change. Joe Biden is the happy warrior
