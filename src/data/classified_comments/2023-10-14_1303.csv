Yeah I do.

>Both modern sexism and traditional sexism exerted a statistically significant effect on vote choice in the 2016 election, with modern and traditional sexists less likely to vote for Clinton, even after controlling for other explanations of vote choice. The separate effects of both measures of sexism are evident in Models I and II, and those effects are sustained even when both variables are entered simultaneously in Model III. Indeed, rather than the effects of both measures of sexism being reduced—as might have been anticipated with both measures having some shared variance—the coefficients for both variables slightly increased. In order to show the substantive effects of both variables on vote choice, the final column of Model III shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for each statistically significant variable across its entire range while all other variables are held constant at their mean or modal values.

>The effects of sexism on vote choice—especially modern sexism—was hardly trivial. A respondent with the highest modern sexist attitudes was 64 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.790 compared to 0.145). Traditional sexism's effect did not rival that of modern sexism in terms of depressing the probability of voting for Clinton at the highest levels of sexism, but was nonetheless still notable. A respondent with the highest level of traditional sexism was 43 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.838 compared to 0.420).

>In addition to showing the effect of sexism on vote choice in 2016, it is also important to consider their effect relative to other variables that were noted as potential explanations of vote choice. The final column in Table 1 (∆ Prob.) shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for all of the statistically significant independent variables. It is notable that modern sexism had a larger effect on vote choice than ideology, and rivaled the effect of racial resentment. Indeed, after party identification and racial resentment, no other independent variable exceeded the effect of modern sexism on voting behavior in 2016. While the effect of traditional sexism on vote choice was not as great as racial resentment, modern sexism, or ideology, it did rival the effects of anti‐immigrant sentiment and was slightly greater than that for anti‐illegal immigrant attitudes. Moreover, traditional sexism had a substantially larger effect than either opposition to free trade or economic anxiety.

>It is plausible that the effects of sexism may vary by sex, especially the effects of modern sexism, given that it is more like a measure of resentment toward “uppity women” so that its effects would be more evident among men than women. Therefore, Table 2 presents the results of separate logistic regressions for men and women.

>Table 2 shows that the effects of modern sexism were more evident among men than women, with the coefficient for men over twice the size of that for women, and almost approaching the effect of party identification on vote choice. Indeed, men with lower levels of modern sexism (scores below 0.450) actually had a higher predicted probability of voting for Clinton than women with similar scores. However, as modern sexism increases for men, the predicted probability of a vote for Clinton drops much more rapidly than that for women. Across the entire range of the modern sexism scale for men there was a difference in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton of 85 percentage points (0.921 compared to 0.074). This compared to a 49 percentage point difference for women (0.752 compared to 0.262). At the very highest levels of modern sexism for men, a vote for Clinton would have been exceedingly rare, and a vote for Trump almost a certainty.

>However, the findings of this article do suggest that sexism should not be ignored as one part of the puzzle as to why Hillary Clinton lost an election she seemed on course to win. Sexism—whether operationalized as modern sexism or traditional sexism—was a significant predictor of vote choice above and beyond other confounding variables. Moreover, modern sexism rivaled the effect of racial resentment, with only party identification having a larger effect on vote choice. Both modern and traditional sexism—along with racial resentment and attitudes toward immigrants in general and illegal immigrants in particular—seem a major part of the story in explaining Clinton's defeat, rather than variables that emphasize opposition to free trade, economic anxiety, or anti‐politician sentiment. Moreover, it helps in explaining Clinton's underperformance among white voters both with and without a college degree. These findings further suggest that the argument that Vice President Joe Biden, or even U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, would have been candidates more likely to defeat Trump in 2016 may have less to do with their economic empathy with voters and more to do with them being men. Quite simply, modern and traditional sexism contributed toward many voters being less favorably disposed to a woman running for president than a man who had never held an elected office prior to running for president. Indeed, if the Democratic Party convinces itself that the only reason Clinton lost in places such as the Rust Belt states in 2016 was her inability to articulate an economic argument and appeal to white voters, then it seems destined to be wasting time fashioning an economic message to such voters whose vote was ultimately more influenced by the aforementioned noneconomic factors. 

>As well as offering an explanation for vote choice in the 2016 election, this article also makes a contribution to the broader literature on the role that sexism and stereotyping play when a woman runs for office, especially an executive office. Out of necessity, prior research has been limited to ascertaining support for a woman in a presidential election by utilizing hypothetical matchups, often in experimental research designs. This article, however, used a nationally representative sample in a real presidential election contest to show that a woman running for president against one of the least politically experienced candidates in the history of presidential elections still activated sexism as a short‐term factor in explaining vote choice. Furthermore, the article suggests that sexism may not have been as salient a predictor of vote choice if the identity of the candidates had been different. The findings lend support to the notion that women who run for the presidency will likely continue to face singular obstacles because of their sex.

You can swallow everything SNOPES tells you to believe if you want.

If you decide you want to look into it yourself you'll find in every comment section of every news, blog, Facebook post thousands of people who recall watching the clip. You'll also find the current Oprah clip cuts before the interview was finished. Someone even pulled an old news article regarding the interview where it discussed the length of the interview which is ~6 minutes short in the clip we see now including quotes from Trump you don't see in the video. 

I can't recall everything I read on it, I quickly tried to find the post which cataloged all the findings but was not able to (at work). In the end believe what you want. Ignorance is bliss.

For starters, all the stuff I saw said that the quote was in an interview with time magazine, not Oprah. In addition I do remember a video of an old Oprah video making rounds on Facebook during the election and even at one point I thought he was going to say the quote but it ended up being something about ""if things got reallly really bad I think I would have to run"" or something along those lines.

Nobody likes government for government's sake, but somehow Republicans have created this narrative that Democrats simply crave government. It's absurd. The narrative should be that Democrats support good government. It's hard to sustain that when one party actively wants to dismantle it as much as they can. 

I liken it to baseball: if the pitcher is not doing well, you don't simply stop pitching. Instead, you replace the pitcher with someone who can do the job better. 

I realize that it's not a perfect analogy: Republicans will argue that some positions in government are not required. But they've tended to apply that argument to necessary governmental services as well. 

For that matter, I remember when Al Gore's ""project"" while in office was to identify and eliminate governmental waste. It did not work perfectly, but the Republicans did nothing to keep working at it.

So, yeah, they will not consistently work no matter how many times you use them. There is a statistical failure rate, and that *increases* the more people use them over a longer time.

>I want to know where the line is. I want to be able to distinguish between ""Society fulfilling its duty to the individual"" and ""The individual taking advantage of society"". I don't know where that line is, or which side of it we're on, but I do know that when I figure it out, I'm going to argue for policies that put us on it, and fuck those people who want it somewhere else.

Wow. I'm *completely backing away from support for your sentiment.* Holy shit. This whole comment is, ""I don't know when I should take responsibility for myself, or when others should take responsibility for themselves, I need the collective to tell me what to do, so I can get angry when someone goes out of line."" Holy. Shit. Wow.  Is this honestly the common sentiment around here? People don't want to think or be responsible for themselves, but want to be *told* what they should do? Wow. I can't even. Is this a parody group?  A cult? WTF?  Do you hear yourself at all? Do you realize how cult-like that sounds?  Honestly, I don't even know how to ask, this is bloody flabbergasting - I'm sincerely sorry if that sounds insulting, but what in the honest fuck, man??

I think that's the problem - not aiming to do things for yourself, first.  And sure, some can't, so they should be helped, but the problem w/ the sentiment of automatically giving things to certain groups is frankly bigoted and/or racist/insulting as it assumes they're automatically less capable by the mere fact that they're part of said group.

Research shows that conservatives' brains are wired for more binary thinking, liberals' brains handle nuance and complexity better. Conservatives also engage in much more hierarchical thinking.

It really is that simple. Iconography is especially important when you engage in hierarchical thinking, it can help separate in-groups from out-groups. America flag good! Canada flag bad. Why do you think those ridiculous red MAGA hats were so popular? They immediately helped Trump supporters organize themselves into an in-group and out-group. I wish I were being facetious, but I'm not. It is that simple.

I'm a veteran but I don't ""love"" our flag. I love our country and the ideas it is supposed to represent. If someone burns the flag I'm not going to get bent out of shape, they are engaging in protected 1st amendment activity, and what is more American than that? I don't like it, but I protected their right to do that. That takes nuanced thinking.

I don't agree that it is.  In fact, I think we're more patriotic, because we're willing to give constructive criticism and we don't wear patriotism on our sleeve.

We recently had bad storms where I live and there was a lot of damage.  Two tree services showed up at my house and both left a card.  One was a local company that had a very normal looking card.  The other one was clearly a travelling group, which is known for ripping people off.

The travelling group left a pamphlet, rather than a card.  The pamphlet was covered with iconographic virtue symbolism, such as the American flag, the Jesus fish symbol and all this other crap that made them easily recognizable as untrustworthy, imo.  So I looked them up, and sure enough, I found lots of complaints.

That's the far right for you.

k13dma8,sabrinahlj,41amebdt,"Sometimes, I do feel very proud to be American. Surprisingly, it's the friends I've made from around the world who have reminded me what I love about this country. They come here to study in the US because of our high-quality education. We have some of the most brilliant scientists and scholars of the world concentrated in major research center cities. My immigrant family members remind me of how much freer the US is than the home country they had to escape. Our press, while racially biased, influenced by monetary interests, often myopic in scope, is fairly free. The privilege to speak without government consequences is not available everywhere. Our religious freedom is even stronger. Legislation like the laws banning religious symbols in our Western Europe counterparts might be attempted here but would be quickly struck down.

On the other hand, there's been so much to be disappointed by in the US recently - our out-of-control mass shootings, woefully inadequate healthcare, tightening restrictions on women's bodily autonomy, rampant police brutality, dependence on fossil fuels, political polarization, rising hatred against trans folks and immigrants, etc. As a Gen Z adult, there's a despondency in knowing that it's unlikely you'll ever be able to afford a home in the place where you grew up. The whole gamut of issues that make flying the flag feel hollow.

I do feel the flag represents every American, especially all the people fighting oppression and working to make this country better.

k3qaoje,Koboldofyou,brsv6jl7k,"To start, people are really bad using the [philosophical idea of logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_logic) arguments. A large percentage of people go: I believe this, so it must be true because I want to believe true things. But they're really bad at learning things, and will hold beliefs with no backing. 

Trumps rhetoric takes advantage of this to set up and reinforce beliefs in people's heads. Trump doesn't say accurate things backed by data, he says outlandish indirect things and people interpret what he means. His supporters walk away with a deep feeling that reinforces their own beliefs. 

In this case he sets up the beliefs ""Voter ID is a no-brainer"" with the underlying *feeling* that ""we use ID all the time for less important things"". But there's no actual logic or examples. 

This rhetoric also presents a red herring to opposition. You say ""Hey that's not true"", and his supporter can go ""of course it's not true, it's not meant to be true"". Because there is never an expectation that what he says is accurate. But now his supporters get additional reinforcement because ""opposition is too dumb to take things non-literally"". And often when challenged supporters will get angry because their beliefs were not based on something they can explain. 

**In summary**: his rhetoric crafts an argument, which reinforces a belief while being impossible to argue against. And challenging that belief causes an emotional reaction which makes the person less likely to accept outside ideas. 

To be clear, I don't think Trump is a mastermind. That's another part of his his rhetoric works. Because it's nonsensical opposition often goes ""He must be a genius manipulator"".

I just can't figure it out for the life of me. When he started making the claims about having to flush toilets 10 or 12 times that was weird too. But then we eventually learned that he had been tearing up documents and trying to flush them. That explains it. Then he started complaining about low flow shower heads. That makes sense too. He probably went to a new hotel room somewhere and experienced the low flow shower heads first hand. But the ID to purchase bread claim is just a complete mystery to me. He's not grocery shopping himself and if he were he'd know that it's not a requirement.

He clearly seems to be trying to insinuate that it's some sort of problem.

If he's remembering having to present ID with a credit card or a check, that practice has to go back earlier than the '80s.

I don't know that he's saying it's a problem now. It seems that his point is that voter IDs aren't a problem given how much you need an ID in other areas of life.

As for the toilets, it's a complaint about low-flow toilets and may be unrelated to flushing notes.

That's certainly not true. Some people have lost their documentation over the years, often when they have to move a lot or they're homeless. Some children of US citizens are born abroad and their parents never bothered getting documentation for them. They're still US citizens. People fall through the cracks.

The guy in the article below suspected he was a US citizen, but he had been born in Mexico and grew up with just a permanent residency card because his mother didn't even know they were all citizens. His legal permanent residency was revoked after he committed a felony and he was going to be deported. He was held for two years in immigration detention before he was able to prove he was a US citizen through his grandfather. He nearly gave up and accepted deportation. How many others are there who do give up?

Yes it is. Even if they have these people detained somewhere, they don't know for certain what their status is.

It doesn't matter. Writing laws without considering how it will affect everybody is how you get bad laws. You have to consider the edge cases and account for them, and there are a ton of people in this country who don't have ID, and even if you do have something like a birth certificate or social security card sitting at home in a box or in your parents' basement a thousand miles away, you may not be able to get it when you're held in custody.

>A good chunk of migrants are being held at local government sanctioned facilities.

A good chunk, but the vast majority of migrants are living free in the US.

>And I assume most of them filed for asylum otherwise there is no reason why they need to be held in the US .

Even if they haven't applied for asylum, they need to be held for a while because the government has to prove that they aren't here legally before they can be deported.

Basically: after ww2, the state of Israel was setup as a haven for Jews.  It was placed in the middle east, which was owned by Britain at the time.  A lot of jews moved there.  Since A lot of people already lived there, so there wasn't exactly spare space, there was a bunch of fighting and some of the people living there were displaced.

Since then there's been off and on fighting between the influx of Jews (many of whom were from Europe), and some of the local, mostly muslim population.  There were also some wars between Israel and some of the other countries in the area, who're mostly muslim and didn't like jews coming in to displace their brethren.

At this point it's basically a large scale feud, with lots of 'grievances' each side has against the other.  The palestinians are upset because they were forcibly evicted from their land, and suffered many deaths and losses.  The israelis are upset because they keep getting attacked (in particular terror attacks targetting civilians, since the palestinians don't have the power to fight israeli militarily), and because the history of ww2 made them fearful.

Israel keeps takin gmore and more land from the palestinians, and treatment of palestinians has gotten somewhat worse over the past ~40 years.  It's kinda turning into an apartheid situation, quite a few people argue it arleady is (and not just people you should ignore, but people like former heads of the Israeli intelligence agency).

There aren't really good guys, just bad guys and worse guys.

Many historical attempts at peace deals were made, but they never really worked out.  Many of the palestinians still want to evict the invaders from their lands.  The israeli want more land, and some of them think the holy land is theirs by right, as it is israel their ancestral homeland.",/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1712iuh/casual_questions_thread/k3zfftu/,1696770649.0,r/PoliticalDiscussion,0.59762245,1,True,2023-10-14_1303
k3zpazj,neverendingchalupas,43qi2lpvc,"It started before WW2 with the break up of the Ottoman empire, the British are placed in charge of administration of Palestine and fuck it up.

Late 1800s you have a bunch of Zionists immigrating to Palestine and the British do not address the situation or limit immigration, it leads to increasing tensions.  The British allowed the immigrants to buy up vast areas of land legally and illegally that farmers were leasing, then push them out, and they refuse to sell land to Arabs or employ them for work...Which again creates an enormous amounts of conflict.

During WW2 you had the formation of militant Zionist terrorist groups that wanted unrestricted immigration for Jewish people that carry out attacks on the civilian population, assassinations, etc.  which leads to more unrest.

After WW2 you have massive amounts of immigration to Palestine of Jewish people.

The previous regulations from the League of Nations, ignored.  The British completely failing at their role as administrators of the region.  The Palestinian mandate from the League of nations: 

>administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.

Thats not a two state solution, thats not a independent state of Israel.  That is a Palestinian state.

The United Nations resolution in 1947, for a two state solution was ignored..

It devolves from there...The declaration of the Israeli state with the surrounding countries attacking.

Fast forward and you have the PLO in control of Palestine, and Israel wants to destabilize it.  So they focus in on a benign religious Islamic group and help to radicalize it, that is how Hamas was created.  Israel helped create the group to undermine the secular Palestinian Liberation Organization.

The people primarily responsible for this are the British and the international community for allowing a shit ton of immigrants in a country that was already struggling, and then the international community allowing the immigrants to form their own country on someone elses land.

Can you name any? There are a tiny amount of Muslims in Congress, and they tend to be among the most progressive and effective members, doing their jobs well, making things better for their constituents.

IMO there's around 7ish clearly identifiable and relevant political groupings in the US, they are:

* Neocons (these guys are much more an elite movement than a popular one though)
* Social Conservatives
* Fiscal Conservatives
* Paleoconservatives
* Progressives
* Working Class Moderates (read: white working class and minorities)
* Technocrats

You can subdivide them further - there's policy differences on things like race between black Democratic moderates and white working class ones for example, but this model is imo ""good enough""
 
Anyways, traditionally the ""mainstream conservatism"" you're talking about, aka [Fusionist Conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusionism) was traditionally made up of Fiscal Conservatives, Neocons and Social Conservatives. The Paleocons were the Republicans' voterbase, but were generally sidelined.

Trump and co. represent Paleoconservatives trying to take over the party. There's a quiet civil war between the Fusionist ""establishment"" and Trump's insurgents. 

However, I think that the war seems to mostly be over. I don't think the GOP will split on those lines, rather Fusionists will slowly get replaced by Trump loyalist Paleocon types.

k4ti8yh,professorwormb0g,u25c4b0s,"Anything that increases turn out tends to favors Democrats indeed! That's why Republicans are so focused on voter suppression.  It's interesting.  Democrat voters are often not inspired and greatly compromise on their candidate. They are a big tent party.  Take Joe Biden.  Nobody was super pumped about him.  He won because of hatred for Trump, not love for Biden. Most people who vote Democrat span a wide variety of political views so it's hard to get someone to please everybody. As we discussed third parties aren't viable, so Democrats are essentially just ""the candidate that's actually going to do *something*'"".   If you had someone far left the centrist Dems wouldn't be enthusiastic.  If you gave someone centrist the far left Dems won't like him.  So this leads to unenthusiastic voters unless you get a real inspirational candidate like Obama seemed when he was running.  A lot of Dems are very critical of corporate America, the system as a whole, distrustful of both the parties and just think the Dems are a better alternative, feel that their voice isn't hard, etc.  So if it's too hard to vote and they have to jump through hoops they might just skip it that year and think whatever, nothing changes anyway.    Where's republican voters tend to fall in line, are nationalists, see voting as their civic duty, etc.  Not to mention many key democratic voters are often minorities and it's easy to disenfranchise them via things like voter ID, laws against people who have criminal records, and so on.  

Republicans are a minority now but the ""land advantage"", skews in their favor.  Gerrymandering has tended to benefit them greater recently because they controlled more state legislatures (and also because democrats dumbly tried gerrymandering reform in places like NY which ended up costing them the majority this past election, but they're trying hard to reverse that right now).  Not to mention that Republicans have control of many federal courts, along with the SCOTUS.   The reason we see so much extremism on the right is because they're clawing onto power using any method possible.  Eventually the GOP is going to need to evolve to keep popular support when demographics changes become too big of a hurdle where the baked in advantages are no longer sufficient to win.  

So yeah I agree that making voting a required civic duty and national holiday will not happen unless democrats have unilateral control.   I don't know if the latter one will even help too much because employers **don't have to give you holidays off**, they just have to pay non exempt workers time and a half.

I think ranked choice voting or approval voting are needed badly to encourage better turnout and kill the spoiler effect, but I'm not sure either party will allow those because the current system benefits both parties remaining dominant.  I personally like approval voting for its simplicity.   States have broad controls over election law so i any change will be very gradual.  

Another solution is to change how representation works instead of doing single member districts.  We could have multi member districts.  Or elect all  candidates at large and allocate representation proportionally.  There is actually some precedent here, as some states used to elect a few reps at largre in addition to mostly single member districts. But this fell out of favor in the mid twentieth century.   

One thing that absolutely need to do is uncap the house.  We are one of the worst represented democracies in the world.  The number of reps should grow with the population, just as it did until 1910.   Smaller districts give better access to your congressperson. It would have the side effect of making the electoral college More likely to follow the popular vote too sense through with me more electors correlated with total population.  

The Senate should be abolished or neutered too, but I think that's a non starter because it would require an amendment.  The Constitution says that every state needs to have equal representation in the Senate and the only way to change this is through unanimous agreement from every state. There's ways to get around this language, but I can't imagine any senator would want to reduce their powers.",/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/177cziy/are_we_watching_a_political_party_the_republicans/k4ti8yh/,1697272171.0,r/PoliticalDiscussion,0.59158593,1,True,2023-10-14_1303

The opposite, but also possible scenario is that MAGA suffers severe enough electoral defeats - and enough of their electorate dies off, because they're old - that they become basically unanimously marginalized within the party leadership.

k4tppwl,Leopath,k8b1y,"Our political and electoral system doesnt support more than 2 political parties. What were are actuslly witnessing is probably anpolitical reallignment. These happen every generation or so where the politicla parties face some kind of massive turbulence that reshapes them and results in a new party system. It happened when FDR got elected and the democrats shifted away from dixiecrats and bourbon democrats that supported laissez faire economics to pro union pro welfare and after FDR pro civil rights. It happened again in 1964 when in the wake of the civil rights act we got the southern strategy and shift towards hardline conservativsm within the republicans. And really solidified in 1980 with the reagan coalition which included evangelicals. Many suspected when Trump got elected in 2016 this was the begining of a new shift and were now starting to see the impact of this.

Essentially the makeup and platforms for both democrats and republicans are about to shift. The thing about these kinds of party systems is that 1 party is usually weaker and has to bend hard in favor of the other side to win power. During the FDR years democrats unequivocally dominated politics as the only Republican to win during that time was Eisenhower who was easily the most left leaning republican to have become president (so much so democrsts even wanted to run him) meanwhile its pretty obvious that post 1964 republicans have dominated as democrats only won with southern candidates like Clinton and Carter or were riding off a massive economic recession like Obama did.

Personally, if you ask me, I think we are shifting to a new political system dominated by democrats where Republicans are going to effectively have to shift hard to the left and what we are experiencing atm is the reactionary right wing anger and frustration at this.

k4r5znp,Federal-Reserve-101,6kku4bf,"I have seen some pretty braindead takes, so here is a decent one:

Gaza is about to be invaded. Hamas hides its resources among the civilian population and does not make an effort to help its people. Israel dropped leaflets telling people to go to southern Gaza, and Hamas responded by telling people to stay home. Hamas actively allows the noncombatants in Gaza to get killed so they can milk their deaths for propaganda value. Hamas does not give a shit about the civilian population of Gaza. This is why their rocket launchers are encamped on hospitals, and not in military bases or somewhere other than the middle of a city.

Israel has strategic goals which need to be accomplished. Because Hamas hides behind the noncombatants of Gaza, this means there is a difficult tug between the two issues of A) how do you kill Hamas fighters and destroy their infrastructure, without also B) not destroying civilian infrastructure. The answer is that if you choose one, you sacrifice the other. For example, Israel gives warnings before it drops bombs on its targets (called roof knocking), giving civilians a chance to escape. This also, however, gives Hamas terrorists in the same zone a chance to escape as well. If you wait too long, it’s true more civilians would get away, but so would the terrorists being targeted. Israel could just as easily not do this, which would result in higher success rates for eliminating targets, but would have higher collateral damage as well. So, Israel gives warnings of different lengths for different targets. Some are long enough for everybody to get away, some not. It’s unfortunate, but how else would they go about taking out the rocket launchers, ammo factories, and terrorist leadership of Hamas?

With regards to the government of Israel, Netanyahu is not a good faith actor. He is beholden to extremists on the right, and if it were left to him alone he would probably just level Gaza and be done with it. That said, there are still restrictions on his power. For one, the Army hates him, and the Generals aren’t about to throw out the entire operational playbook just for him. Two, he is now stuck in a National Unity government with his biggest political opponent, who is a centrist. Three, Israel is keenly aware of media coverage of its conflicts and would like to avoid looking bad. All of this contributes to IDF trying its best to reduce collateral damage in Gaza, but that is very difficult when Hamas hides within populated areas.

The upcoming invasion (which I guarantee is going to occur) can be seen as further evidence of this. Israel could *easily* level Gaza with bombs and obliterate Hamas by simply destroying every structure in the strip. The rockets they hide in their tunnels won’t be of much use to them if every single building in Gaza is gone and they have nowhere to launch them from. Instead, launching a ground invasion will allow for more precise targeting, but also means that Israel is seriously risking its own soldiers. This is a big deal because IDF has become very averse to ground combat in the last few years. Ground invasion means soldiers can physically go in and clear out the tunnels, eliminate terrorists in the street, and physically enter buildings to destroy infrastructure targets (rocket launchers, ammo factories, weapons depots) by hand. The current bombings are designed to soften the territory up (because Hamas is deeply integrated) in preparation for the land invasion. This is absolutely necessary for Israel because going in with no preparation beforehand from air forces means walking into cities with thousands of terrorists hidden in urban structures. Urban warfare is not fun. Rubble warfare is much easier, since terrorists have less places to hide.

With regards to this specific evacuation warning, yes, 24 hours is a short time for 1 million people to move. But that is not the point. 24 hours is an extremely long time for terrorists to set up traps, take up positions in the city, and prepare their defenses. 24 hours is a compromise time between what is strategically sensible (not giving the enemy advanced warnings), and limiting civilian casualties (giving more warnings). It is not designed for 1.1 million people to go south in 24 hours. It is designed for as much as possible of the 1.1 million to get out. Gaza is not that big. Those who are able could probably make it on foot within 2-3 hours. Of course, this is not an ideal scenario since people who are injured or disabled or elderly will have a difficult time, but it is the most that IDF calculated could be afforded. Every hour in advance that Gaza is warned is another hour that Hamas readies for invasion, and more fatalities on the battlefield for Israeli soldiers.

That said, not everybody who remains is going to be killed. Israel is not the Wehrmacht, going through villages and shooting people. Instead, these people will risk becoming collateral damage. Whether from stray tank munitions, Hamas suicide bombers, additional air strikes, or more. IDF is telling those who can get out to do so, and warning those who can’t to prepare. Did Israel get these warnings from Hamas before 1,000 terrorists poured over the border and raped and killed babies, pregnant mothers, and partygoers? Don’t think so. Because of that, Hamas’s attacks were wildly successful in inflicting maximum damage. 1,300 Israelis killed, hundreds taken prisoner, 5,000 wounded. If Israel did the same thing in Gaza last week, I’m not sure Hamas would still exist right now - but neither would most of the people living in Gaza.

It is very difficult to fight an organization like Hamas. It is a death cult which uses civilians as human shields. When the man shooting at you is hiding behind his wife, how do you defend yourself without risking the wife’s life? Hamas actively told its citizens to stay home and ignore IDF warnings. They want their own civilians to die so they can win the media war and turn people against Israel by accusing Israel of war crimes which they, themselves, have caused. 

So the short answer is, yes. Israel acts in good faith. IDF has to weigh strategic considerations against humanitarian ones, and that is an extremely difficult thing to do when the enemy has no regard for human life on either side. In the long run, it is likely more people will be saved by the destruction of Hamas than will be killed in the upcoming war. This is the calculus of Israel, but at the end of the day, Gaza will be a better place without Hamas - despite the likely civilian toll. Hamas had an opportunity to turn Gaza into Dubai when they took over in 2006 (with the people’s support, I might add). Instead, they turned it into one big ISIS training camp.

ddj81wk,VStarffin,i4512,"It's astonishing to watch the standards we have strived to set for our leaders diminish so rapidly. People mock this, but the reality is that this degrades our institutions, badly. It lowers the bar. It makes this and even worse acceptable over time. People laugh at this, but they aren't shocked by it. We should be shocked by it. And again, the blame in my mind lies almost entirely with GOP leadership.

One of the things I've taken away from this election the most is that party leadership matters so much, and that the advancement of craven, immoral people to the leadership of Republican ranks has been absolutely poisonous to this country.

The key thing here is that most people do not care about most issues. They really don't. Most people don't feel that strongly about, well, anything. Especially abstract policies or generic ""corruption"" which doesn't personally effect them. This is a problem with democracy, because you're asking people to make decisions based on issues they neither pay attention to, nor care about. In order for this system to work, the people in charge need to guide their constituencies in good directions. Leadership is not a one way thing - it's not like people say ""we like X"" and their elected officials just do it.

If you had gone back a few years, and asked most Republicans whether they wanted a President who was trying to personally profit off the Presidency, everyone would have said no. And if the GOP leadership - united - says ""this is wrong and unacceptable and the President needs to stop"" it would matter. It would signal to other Republicans that its ok to oppose this kind of stuff.

But the GOP doesn't do it. Either because they are cowed or craven, or because they hate Democrats more than they cared about these principles, they don't do it. And so their base has absolutely no sense that this is bad - it's just another partisan fight. There's no unified, independent sense of ""this is wrong independent of party"". And so even stuff like torture or corruption has really turned into partisanship - Republicans hate corruption by Democrats, don't give a shit about it when the GOP President is astonishingly, brazely, corrupt.

It's not enough to represent people. You need to have some semblance of moral courage. In order for a country to become evil or corrupt, the people don't need to be evil or corrupt. They just need to be indifferent enough to *let* an evil or corrupt person get in charge. We're doing that now.

We're in this mess because of Republican voters in the 80s and early 2000. Republican voters aren't going to vote in the solution to the problems they caused.

Democracy is not a goal; it is a means to a goal.   And in this case, it fails.   It fails due to public choice theory.   It is a systemic problem.

There are two ways to solve problems: one is to let each person attempt to persuade others and work voluntarily with them; the other is to gang up and use force against others.

My response was this:

I feel very differently. It is much more difficult for a person to change a long-and-deeply-held belief than it is for somebody to believe the same as those around them. I support gay marriage (and respect for gay people in general) not because I examined the argument and decided in favor based on reason, nor because I am inherently compassionate, but mainly because my family raised me to believe that gay people were not bad for being who they are. It was easy for me to come to the right position, because it was almost the default for me. I have far more respect for somebody (like Sen. Portman) who came to support gay marriage only after a personal struggle with his deeply held beliefs, whatever it may have been that kindled that struggle (in this case the revelation of his sons sexuality).

I know that my distaste for Clinton isn't because of sexist reasons, but I can see why you thought it that way (especially when, I'd wager money, a prime underlying motivator of people _not_ voting for her was sexist in nature).

Oddly enough, I am friends with a person that was extremely high up in her organization, and many of my friends have either met her or know her. On a social level she's a wonderful person. Politically, I was extremely put off by two things: 1) her not divorcing Bill (although this could entirely go both ways, and private life stuff... should probably stay private, so I've got to let it slide although it grates on my nerves) and 2) her becoming a senator in NY.  I mean, Illinois? Sure. It's her home state. Arkansas? Definitely. But NY? Tell me you are a political monster without telling me... That'd probably be the way.

Anyways, I voted for her because... what was the alternative? Someone who was insulting disabled reporters and saying racially and sexually inflammatory things? Like I said, I'd have crawled over broken glass to vote for her, and still would, any day, over Trump.

jysastx,martingale1248,58q8iyyo,"It's unfortunate that the ""Hillary lost because she didn't campaign in Wisconsin"" thing is spouted out as if it's fact by people who consider themselves educated about politics. But the facts are A) all the serious analysis by actual experts say it is -- at best -- inconclusive whether her presence there would have made any difference (several, like Nate Silver, definitively say it wouldn't have); and B) Wisconsin was worth 10 electoral votes, so even if she had won the state, she still loses the electoral college 294 - 237.

&#x200B;

But if you are trying to defend someone's actions, or salve your own conscience for spending 2016 whining and raging because your guy didn't win the primary it's easy -- and comforting, I imagine -- to say, ""She ran a bad campaign, all she had to do was go to Wisconsin"" and there you go: self-administered absolution.",/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/167rasj/has_bernie_sanders_been_neutered_by_fear_of/jysastx/,1693645869.0,r/PoliticalDiscussion,0.59083277,1,True,2023-10-14_1303
jysle0l,DHooligan,6e2sh,"Clinton didn't campaign in Michigan either and lost here. The point isn't that Wisconsin was the single difference maker, it's that her campaign made several errors by focusing on the wrong states and executing a poor strategy. The word ""arrogance"" gets thrown around a lot when it comes to Clinton's campaign and it applies to their relationship to Bernie Sanders as well.

It's not strange or ahistorical that Bernie would continue his campaign to the convention. Obviously he was going to endorse Clinton in the general, but in return he wanted some say in shaping the party platform and felt his performance in the primary earned him that right. Clinton's campaign shut them out and refused to offer any concessions, apparently believing any catering to the left wing of the party would result either cost them in the general, or taking the left wing for granted and denying they had any leverage to shape the party platform. The tension was obvious, but it didn't have to be. It was in Clinton's best interest to unite the party going into the general, but either she didn't care to or was incapable of it. If Clinton's team had been more flexible, they could have incorporated a few ideas and strategies from Sanders and probably had a better chance in the general. In 2020, Biden's campaign welcomed Sanders' campaign's input when shaping the party platform. Build Back Better, although it didn't pass, was a proposal that Biden couldn't have and probably wouldn't have championed without Sanders' influence.

Anyway, I don't think when people say, ""She didn't campaign in Wisconsin,"" they're saying that specifically was the difference-maker. They're saying that the decision not to campaign in a state she ultimately lost by 10,000 votes was illustrative of a failing overall strategy.",/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/167rasj/has_bernie_sanders_been_neutered_by_fear_of/jysle0l/,1693653418.0,r/PoliticalDiscussion,0.58033663,1,True,2023-10-14_1303

She did campaign in Michigan, including the day before the election, and sent Obama there. She had been up comfortably there until the last week of the election.

I realize this might come as a shock, but the campaign was run by smart people with tons of information we don't have, who were balancing a lot of competing objectives, as is true of every presidential campaign. And people sitting on the sidelines after the fact acting as if they're experts, well, I'm reminded of the press coverage.

If you read the Clinton website in 2016, or watched her on the debate stage, or watched her surrogates on the Sunday shows, you know exactly why.   In most cases she agreed with Obama or Biden on policy, but every place she disagreed (foreign policy, economic reform, tax reform) she took a position less popular with young voters.

In 2020 I expected Biden to do the same thing, to fail to learn the lessons.  He didn't.  If you read the Biden 2020 website, his policy proposals were geared towards young people.   He allowed his track record to make the case to boomers and went hard courting young people on policy.

"" Talking to those young folks, what is the No. 1 issue? The No. 1 issue, of course, is criminal justice reform. I showed them a platform for criminal justice reform.

This was true for several policies.   Argued against them during the primary.  Adopted them to her general election platform way, way to late to have any credibility on them.   

Another challenge is that she was plagued by leaks from high dollar fundraisers where she had promised to oppose economic and tax reform policies.

Hillary's biggest problem was that her campaign (and the media) never understood what messaging worked and was too fixated on the shiny object that was Donald Trump's horrendous comments and behavior.  Take her first debate for example.  Hillary spent the first half of that debate brilliantly prosecuting the case against Donald Trump on economic issues.  She brought up that Trump stiffed small businesses and didn't pay taxes, but also laid out her plan including that taxes would have to be raised for the wealthy because the wealthy got almost all the economic gains in the past decade.  Trump came off as an insane bigot in the second half of the debate, and Hillary brought up Trump and the Miss Universe.  So what did the Clinton's campaign focus on going forward?  Basically the Miss Universe stuff for the next week.  Focus groups showed that the Trump stiffing small businesses was the most effective attack of him.

Sanders only told his supporters to vote for Clinton after the fact, and had to plead with his own campaign to stop the negative messaging, which they never did...He was entirely unsuccessful at regaining control of his campaign which in large part had become disillusioned and wanted to watch the country burn to the ground around them.

The DNC was smearing Bernie before results were in. Whether this was politically motivated I don’t know but I do know that after Hillary got the nomination the Bernie supporters did not vote.

jytika6,koolaid-girl-40,lvrsyqk,"Bernie and Biden (and Hillary) all have extremely similar policy platforms. I remember reading their websites back in 2015 and having a hard time finding many differences, other than Bernie being more aggressive with certain policies such as proposing medicaid for all instead of a public option. Many would argue a public option is actually a better health care system for the US since it offers universal, cheaper healthcare for all while still allowing people the choices they want. The public option plan is very similar to the Bismarck healthcare model in Germany that has been ranked as the top healthcare quality in Europe. 

So I don't think Bernie has been ""neutered"". I think he genuinely agrees with Biden's policy goals for the most part and appreciates the strides he's made in areas such as global climate change (passing the biggest pro-climate bill by the dollars that any country so far in his build back better plan). Perhaps he recognizes that Biden's long-term relationships with both sides of the isle and moderate approach to economic policy is one of the reasons he was even able to get that passed. Above all, I think Bernie believes in democracy, so if more Americans support Biden's approach to these issues than his, then he accepts it wholeheartedly.

He poisoned the well for Clinton before dropping out. By the time he “endorsed” her it was far too late. Then his supporters spent the rest of the general campaign railing against her, crying “rigged”, saying she and Trump were the same, she should drop out because of the emails, etc etc.

Bernie also is opposed to, as Dr Cornel West says, the neofascism of Trump and will do whatever it takes to stop it. Including backing Biden and whatever Biden accomplishes. He has no interest whatsoever in undermining Biden.

The whole Marianne Williamson primary campaign against Biden, when you dig deep and understand the history of primarying a sitting incumbent, is just Bernie or Bust by another name. Even though Bernie has already endorsed Biden and has nothing to do with the campaign. Again, he has no interest in undermining Biden. Now, the Marianne campaign have every right to do it, since if they win one or even a dozen primaries, it allows Biden to not seek re-election gracefully as a majority of Americans that have been polled don’t want him to run again. But I also hope they realize that they’ll have to fight at the convention too as the rest of the party will probably want to pick Kamala Harris to lead them in the next election, regardless if she polls poorly head-to-head against Trump.

>Some scholars counteract this argument by saying that any stereotype, whether positive or negative, is a hindrance to the advancement of a group. Scott B. Vickers quotes Susan Shown Harjo ""the use of any stereotype in the portrayal of Indians is considered ... to be contributory to their dehumanization and deracination."" This viewpoint is shared by the many academic disciplines that study the issue and have passed resolutions calling for the end of all Native American mascots and images in sports: the Society of Indian Psychologists (1999), the American Counseling Association (2001), the American Psychological Association (2005), and the American Sociological Association (2007).

In short, having an animal mascot is one thing, but using a term that refers to an ethnic group takes away from the depth and complexities of their history by hiding it behind a stereotype -- even if that stereotype represents courage and bravery.

Now, it's true that this argument as stated would apply to a lot of other mascots (such as ""The Patriots""), and the reason why those other mascots don't seem to be as important is because currently understanding the depth and complexity of Native American history is important to folks.

Probably because his outlandish behavior has been chiseled into the American psyche for the last ~~two~~ three decades and really isn't anything new.

I agree with that but for different reasons.  Very little attention is paid to her actual words.  Most discussion is meta-discussion about what pundits say about her.  Its a fairly sexist dynamic actually.  Trump, meanwhile, has been allowed to define himself.  And he is pretty deplorable.

k4twcmg,ih-shah-may-ehl,191ay6h,"I live in Belgium. English is my 4th language. Thank you. I am fairly well traveled but haven't been to Israel.

Belgium is also a deeply divided country. Not ethnically but cultural, linguistic, and political. We come from an era where flemish and walloon people hated each other, and there was a lot of discrimination and sometimes violence. 

Like Israel, Belgium is not historically a country but an artificially created one with people who didn't want anything to do with each other. Sure, we didn't have the same levels of violence, but imo that is only because we had 2 world wars to keep us busy, and afterwards, there was only rubble, and no one had the desire for another fight.

Anyway, the only reason we have been able to more or less defuse the situation is by recognizing and later politically defining the borders of the language regions and then keeping them in place. The idea is: everyone stays on their side, and when there are issues, they are resolved on each side, but the border always stays the same. If either the flemish or the walloons had encroached on each other, it would all have gone to shit.

That is my main argument. In my opinion, peace would have been much easier to achieve over time if the borders of 67 had been respected and palestine not been pushed ever more inwards by settlements and divided by Israel controlled corridors.",/r/news/comments/177g2wj/stanford_suspends_teacher_after_reportedly/k4twcmg/,1697282593.0,r/news,0.84217936,1,True,2023-10-14_1303

k4t70io,GoochMasterFlash,apeo4,"College 101 is likely a humanities transition course that is intended to help students adjust to the meaning of certain topics that are often used as buzzwords by non academics. It would look like the whole course is random and about buzz words but only because the point is to de buzz the buzz words, if that makes sense. You could easily have a whole course on intros to completely different topics like that such as colonialism, sovereignty, gender, race, neoliberalism, etc. most anything highly politicized really that people often have entrenched yet uninformed opinions about. 

It seems stupid if youve never sat in humanities classrooms over and over where a bunch of college students are trying to have a discussion about something important but everyone is talking past each other because they started on completely different pages and are defining things completely differently (usually people dont read their assignments and think they can just BS discussions using prior knowledge, and this wouldnt be near as much of a problem if they just read but I digress).

Getting freshman an intro to colonialism and other topics before they end up talking about them in every humanities class they take is actually a very good idea. Any other version of “college 101” that is like some kind of welcome to college type bullshit sounds like it would be a true waste of money.

Stanford in particular tolerates some off-the-charts lunacy. Read up on how the school treated conservative Judge Duncan in a speech a few months back. He basically got heckled and ambushed by students, which was bad enough (“Judge Duncan can’t find the clit”, one poster read), but then the DEI administrator—you know, an official representative of the school—came up to the stage and gave a five-minute speech decrying how evil his decisions were.

63 BCE - colonized and ethnically cleansed by the Roman Empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt#Aftermath). Region is renamed Syria Palaestina.
 
628 CE - ethnically cleansed via genocide by the Byzantine empire. Many jews go into exile. https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.22756

638 CE - colonized by the Islamic Empire. Arabs settle the land, with Arab culture, language, and the religion of Islam coming to dominate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Land_of_Israel#Exile_under_Babylon_(586%E2%80%93538_BCE) (see Islamic Rule)
 
1099 CE - colonized, ethnically cleansed, and at times murdered en-masse during the Christian-Muslim conflicts of the Crusades (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora – see Byzantine, Islamic, and Crusader Era)
 
1516 CE - colonized by the Ottoman empire which decreed that Jews could immigrate to and settle anywhere within the Ottoman Empire, except in Palestine. From 1882 until their defeat in 1918, the Ottomans continuously restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine#:~:text=In%201881%20the%20Ottoman%20governmental,and%20land%20purchases%20in%20Palestine.)
 
1917 CE - colonized by the British Empire after the collapse of the Ottoman empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine)
 
 
***A Timeline of Resistance***
Much like other historically tribal people's who were subject to colonial powers, the jews have a long history of resistance against imperial forces, with mixed results.
 
167 BCE - The Maccabean Revolt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt) - Celebrated every year during the Jewish festival Hanukkah - Defeated the Seleucid Empire via guerilla warfare, establishing an independent Kingdom of Judea.

66 CE - First Jewish-Roman War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War) - The revolt lasted 7 years, with more than a million jewish civilians killed in what ultimately ended in a failure to remove the Romans from Israel

Vegas will be reliably blue in another cycle or two, due to the Reno area growing so rapidly. Countless numbers of jobs seem to be pouring in. It's literally like 30 minutes from California. Also fun fact: it's further west than LA.

After the US finally pulled out of Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge came to power next door in Cambodia, US Hawks said nothing while major Doves pushed for action. Some red sympathetic leftists dispelled the reports (the Right's claims of a Vietnam bloodbath never came true), but major Democrats wanted to stop Pol Pot, but Congress, the military, and the public were too tired of the last attempts (mismanaged by Nixon and the Pentagon) in SE Asia to go back.

In your rousing defence of Democrats in regard to American inaction over Pol Pot, you conveniently fail to mention that both the House and the Senate were controlled by Democrats. Nixon was a dick, but he inherited the Vietnam war and won the Vietnam war. It was congressional Democrats who cut off funding to the SVA when the North broke the treaty and invaded.

Indeed it is the emotionally charged persons of each group that remain very lowly educated in even the largest sects of Islam. Which is why education is key to prevent the grassroots violence from escalating to where it is now. People are willing to kill each other because they believe the other side is wrong --- which is not what persons of knowledge and Islamic role models would do.

I do agree with your lack of having anyone in charge and the chaos .... this is ridiculous though, to attempt to fathom how things get so out of hand. I guess I am living a relatively privileged life, though where I have access to so much others unfortunately do not, and perhaps that is why I can't entirely relate.",/r/news/comments/2bl8d7/isis_orders_all_women_and_girls_in_mosul_to/cj6hcic/,1406213390.0,r/news,0.845405,1,True,2023-10-14_1303

One of the major themes of my heritage that's has been passed down is never with a capital N give up. Meaning don't roll over and give up whenever some whacked political or religious BS like this is handed to you. I know the world thinks us Muricans are violent weirdos when it comes to our guns but this shit is why. As I type this my 9 yr old daughter is sitting beside me and as I look at her I know I would fight till death to protect her from sick fucks like those committing these acts. I can not fathom any father that doesn't feel the same. Is there no one in these countries that will stand up and say enough!  Is everyone there so brainwashed by this sickness called Islam that they will do nothing when evil is rampant among them. As a culture any parent that subjects a child to this in my mind deserves nothing but sorrow and tribulations.
