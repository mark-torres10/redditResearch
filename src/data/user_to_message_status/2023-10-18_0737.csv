A year ago I would have said otherwise.  But Bernie opened our eyes to the pure evil that is Clinton.

The only thing real Bernie supporters should be debating is whether to vote Stein or Trump directly.

Ironically enough, Trump's policies will likely hurt the minorities that voted for Clinton in the primaries more than anyone.  Delicious irony there- payback's a bitch!   Being progressive means being willing to sacrifice the most vulnerable if it helps us economically in the long run.
