I think if somebody is incapable of caring for themselves or is creating a public health issue, they shouldn’t be allowed to remain on the streets unhoused. I think we should pay for treatment, for a safe living space, but I just don’t agree with it being optional to stake out and occupy a public space as your personal living space, especially when sanitation is a problem
