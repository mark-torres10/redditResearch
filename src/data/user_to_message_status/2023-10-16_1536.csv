Stanford officials declined to comment on the personnel matter, instead referring to their announcement Wednesday that they had removed the person from the classroom while they look into the allegations. In their statement, university officials said that “academic freedom does not permit the identity-based targeting of students.” 

The incident occurred amid rising campus tensions around the country as many students and university employees take sides on the war. College campuses have long been a breeding ground of passionate, often angry debate over Israeli-Palestinian relations. But Stanford officials said in their statement that students on both sides of the issue have reported heightened anxiety and fear since war broke out.
