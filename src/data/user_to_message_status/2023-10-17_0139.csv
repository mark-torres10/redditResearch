One faction of wealthy donors is intent on exacting revenge on the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust former speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to people familiar with the matter.

“They are total pieces of s---,” said Andy Sabin, a longtime Republican donor and metalworks executive. Sabin told CNBC he’s encouraging fellow donors not to give or raise money for members like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led the anti-McCarthy drive and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, a moderate who sided with hardliners against the California leader.

Another group of financiers want to take on Republicans who opposed the top candidate to replace McCarthy, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, these people explained.

“They’re angry. They’re all saying, ‘don’t give, don’t raise any money,’” a Republican fundraiser said.

One faction of wealthy donors is intent on exacting revenge on the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust former speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to people familiar with the matter.

“They are total pieces of s---,” said Andy Sabin, a longtime Republican donor and metalworks executive. Sabin told CNBC he’s encouraging fellow donors not to give or raise money for members like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led the anti-McCarthy drive and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, a moderate who sided with hardliners against the California leader.

Another group of financiers want to take on Republicans who opposed the top candidate to replace McCarthy, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, these people explained.

“They’re angry. They’re all saying, ‘don’t give, don’t raise any money,’” a Republican fundraiser said.

You will likely continue to vote blue no matter who and act surprised pickachu face when more things come out because you would rather be in lockstep with your actual nazi and fascist friends than be alone and stand up for something. I understand though because it’s human nature to want to belong to a group and it’s tough to be alone and hold values and principles that don’t align with the group.,"

The saddest part is they will probably STILL vote blue no matter who. Until these people renounce the people who are putting them in danger and promise to do better in the future then I have zero sympathy for them.","
