Everybody should have the opportunity to have a baby. Money should not be involved when it comes to having a baby. Neither should money be involved when it comes to health. That is why every other nation agrees on these things. Not even the most extreme right wing candidates would dare to suggest otherwise. They would get 0 votes. Speaking as a Scandinavian.

Bernie Sanders would fit perfectly in the middle of our political system. Only in America are people stupid enough believe he's a communist.

He's proposing getting rid of the insurance system. Everybody would be insured. What changes? Only that the insurance companies don't make billions in profit. Same hospitals and same doctors. This insurance system looks like a total scam from the outside. 

Instead of the money going to the insurance companies. It goes to government. And the government insures everybody.  Everybody should be insured. Nobody should have to go bankrupt because they got sick. As simple as that.","
