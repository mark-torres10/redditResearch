    >The move to recess comes as it became clear that Scalise would not have the votes to win the gavel on the House floor today, and members complaining of a rushed process.

 Well my days of not taking the GOP seriously are certainly coming to a middle.

Which wasn't even enough to stop 15 rounds for McCarthy so yeah, he does have a point that they are super dysfunctional in their inability to coalesce around a choice.

Maybe if the RNC had a platform and wasn't simply recycling the same platform (literally) since the 2016 election; It even mentions the current administration in the negative, which was Obama in 2016 but was a self own in 2020 when it was Trump and they reused it word for word.  They couldn't modify it without voting on changes / a new platform, and they either feared they couldn't get consensus and/or didn't want to publicize the party fighting that would have been.

So instead they stand for nothing since they refuse to acknowledge what they stand for.  Recycling the 2016 platform was a procedural move to avoid admitting they don't know.

And what happens when the party is so divisive that they can't figure out what they stand for?  Morons get in on vagueness and we find an inability to function.","
