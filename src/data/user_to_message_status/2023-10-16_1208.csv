Socialized medicine I grew up with as well, and I still have it (Canadian).  I can tell you the US's is far superior.  Canadians are dying because of it, because of wait times.  We've had people die in the waiting room.  And if someone wants to say I'm full of shit, Google it.  Our healthcare system is broken, not the US's.

Hospitals also know that insurers will only pay x% of the base negotiated rate. Consequently, hospitals arbitrarily inflate the cost per procedure so that base rate - x% insurer discount = what they want to be paid. This works fine for the insured, but when an uninsured person gets a negotiated procedure, the hospital still bills the base rate, hence why you see people with invoices showing hundreds of dollars for an individually packaged Tylenol.","

I've talked to people who think that ANY amount of manipulation, by the media, by their party of choice, and by their candidate, is to be tolerated over trump. Look at this list of shit CNN has tried to pull this election:

1. [CNN would rather give you a sappy heartwarming LIE than admit this woman wants violence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8Cn6boqcA&feature=youtu.be)

2. [CNN and Anderson Cooper lie about past reporting they've done, and pretend that audio of Hillary cackling on about a child rape case is somehow ""not authenticated""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpwPwhvabi8&feature=youtu.be)

3. [Here's CNN's Don Lemon doing the god damned EXACT SAME THING.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?)

4. [Here's CNN pretending that looking at Wikileaks is illegal... But it's ok for them to do it... because they're the media...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-beYBLrkNAg)

5. [Here's CNN coaching their ""focus group"" on what to say after the debate... because FUCK THE TRUTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI)

6. [CNN doesn't want to tell us what Trump *actually said*, so they'll just doctor his tweets and make shit up. No big deal right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Eps97Mp_s)
7. [It's always so unfortunate when technical issues cause cuts in feed every time someone say something bad about Hillary... especially when they were with Bernie till the end!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYRN8Clddw)

8. [Of course they would employ Donna Brazile, head of the fucking DNC, who is happy to pass along debate questions to Hillary. At least until she got caught...](http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/31/donna-brazile-shared-additional-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign-identified-her-tipster/)

9. [And then the same thing happened for Wolf Blitzer.

Again, all this shit happened in the last 2 months, and this is from ONE ORGANIZATION.


So yea, the fact that CNN has any viewers left after this disgrace, along with the Daily Beast and Huffpo (Which employed convicted felon Bob Creamer who was just fired for widespread election fraud), is a testament to how much lying people are willing to tolerate and endorse... because Hillary Clinton must. just. be. that. damn. good.","

Everyone tries to blame the insurance companies, but it's the whole system that's broken IMO. Until you can get hospitals, doctors, and drug companies to stop raising/reduce costs it's going to get worse. My insurer (UHC) dropped a big provider here in Houston because that provider keeps raising rates to unreasonable levels. I'm glad they're putting their foot down against skyrocketing costs, but it's going to leave a lot of folks finding new providers or paying out of network costs.
