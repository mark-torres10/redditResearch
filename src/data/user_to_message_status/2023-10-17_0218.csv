For example the single payer system in Ontario does not cover autism therapy like IBI or ABA with many families paying out of pocket fully or moving. I have a child with ASD. He has therapy 25 hrs a week. I work for who I work for specifically because the benefit package and compensation in general allows me to improve his quality of life. You push M4A and eliminate private insurance; if the government decides my child's therapy isn't worth it I have no where in the US I can move to in order to change that fact.

There will be rationing. There will be shortages. Drs as it is often don't take new medicare patients due to reimbursement rates.","
