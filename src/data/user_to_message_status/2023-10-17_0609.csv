Nope. I supported Bernie because I knew Hillary was a deeply flawed candidate over a year ago. I am not voting for her, especially not after all the revelations about her corruption and collusion. This sub makes it sound like Trump is the wannabe tyrant but I have some news for you - it's Hillary Clinton that acts in this mannerism.

I spent way too many years in college (and most of that time teaching). I felt that I witnessed a collapse in standards in a very short period of time.

Just as one example, when I started as a student, if you cheated you would be either expelled entirely or fail the course. By the time I left academia (about 11 years later, same university), at worst the student would fail that one particular assignment/test. Also, I witnessed students make a Facebook group bitching about how about how difficult/unfair a test was (this was against a professor who was excellent at explaining the concepts, and was only slightly tougher than average). The University caved into the students and forced the professor to let them redo it.
