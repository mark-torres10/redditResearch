I didn't vote in 2016. I fucked up and thought Hillary was a shoe in. I've spent the past 3.5 years trying to right my wrong. Voting in every election, hosting stand-outs, volunteering with multiple campaigns from the local level, to Senate and Biden/Harris. 

*""If Biden doesn't win, will I be able to say, in complete honesty, that I gave it* ***everything*** *I could?""* was the question I lived by since he won the primary. I'm sitting here by myself crying. I'm so proud that DECENCY won. I'm so proud of the volunteers I've worked alongside, who have so much passion and spent every day working for free to try to help make things better. I'm just really, really happy, but it's bittersweet. We need to come together, because united we stand, divided we fall.
