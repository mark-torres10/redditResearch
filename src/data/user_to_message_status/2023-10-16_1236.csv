I just got a quote for a procedure that I NEED to get done that'll take about 1 hour.

I’ve worked in insurance and let me tell you we’ve butted heads with medical providers so often that it’s fair to say we almost hate each other. Medical facilities often try to overbill for services they didn’t even provide.

My favorite is when someone gets an X-ray and gets charged like 500 dollars..and then when the hospital finds out they have insurance they up the charge to like 3,000.

If you think insurance companies own the system you’re grossly uninformed. Insurance companies are merely trying to survive in a broken system.","

I think you'll be hard pressed to find people who think health care is fine as is. Many would love to see the system fixed, if only to make it more affordable.

The problem lies in that those who are for M4A are so loud they not only drown out those with other ideas, but mock those others or worse, insult them.

Not wanting universal healthcare does not make a bad person, or a monster, or a racist, or whatever, it just means I prefer other ideas.

To me, just ""making the rich pay for it"" (regardless of what the issue is - college, healthcare, SocSec, etc) - throwing money around doesn't solve the problem of why the system is broken or not working as intended for alot of people.

I'd like to identify what's causing the problems and fix them. Ideally, this will bring costs back to affordable.","

I agree. I am on the poverty stricken side of things, so when Obamacare was initiated, I ended up getting really good blue care health insurance for absolutely free. It was great, & I was able to get myself checked out when I needed & it was definitely a relief. BUT, I watched other people in my life get hit SO hard with skyrocketing insurance payments. People who had their healthcare all covered on their own dollar or through their employer were now struggling to afford their once very affordable (to them) insurance policy. Even though Obamacare greatly benefited people like me, I didn't think it was right to stick it to the people in a higher tax bracket just so that I could get a leg up. I think hard working people should be able to keep what they earn & decide how they want to spend their money. (I have always worked full time too, just not making as much $)

We as a country need to figure something out, with capitalism in mind. I think instead of politicians being the ones to make a plan, maybe we should bring together great minds like Sam Harris, & Jordan Peterson to give us fresh ideas as to how to handle this overbearing issue of healthcare.

While data is obviously still coming in, it might be worthwhile to note that the situation might be less “your savings caused everyone else’s premiums to skyrocket” and more a case of “everyone’s premiums were going to skyrocket anyways, but because of the ACA yours didn’t”. [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071415/did-obamacare-make-premiums-go.asp).

Similarly while actual healthcare costs went up there’s a decent chance that was driven more by the fact that there are now more people insured (so more market demand) than the actual provisions of the ACA itself. [Source](https://ldi.upenn.edu/brief/effects-aca-health-care-cost-containment)

Again, there’s still *a lot we don’t know here*. I just think it’s important to make sure we don’t skip over the fact that there’s a level in between “totally stops all bad things” and “does nothing/makes things worse”. A system that prevents *some* bad things but not all obviously isn’t perfect, but could still be considered to be better than before. (i.e. if everything was going to go up in cost by 10%, but the new system made some people’s go up by only 6% then even if the system didn’t fully fix the problem it’s still better than nothing).","
