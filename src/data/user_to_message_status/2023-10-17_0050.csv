Well that's presuming that all Republicans are interested in actually not ceding power to and compromising with Democrats on every day that ends in Y.  Hint: That's not compromise, that's just slowly giving Democrats everything.

I wish they would, but it is not necessarily likely.

That's why we're without a speaker.  A few republicans were tired of that.  In that light, a powerless congress incapable of passing anything is better than a Democrat congress sometimes officiated by someone who happens to have an (R) behind their name.

They *are* in trouble, because many Republicans aren't really all that republican or conservative at all and willingly run along on that compromise treadmill without end, perfectly happy with starving to death.

An unfortunate thing that the people sick of the ""establishment"" or ""uniparty"" as some call it had to appear to ally with democrats.  I mean, it's obvious the Democrats wanted chaos and another chance at the seat, but that doesn't mean every vote had that same intent.

If they get it, it's because the establishment wills it, not the people who happened to vote with democrats to try to shake the Republicans out of that ""go along to get along, as long as the democrats don't falsely call me wasist any more"" weak mental state of surrender.

Whether they are belly up or just flat out Rino's, they're the reason the Republicans can't get it together.  People trying to frame the few good ones are the problem.","
