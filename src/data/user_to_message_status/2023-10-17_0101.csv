Hamas rose to power 17 years ago in 2006, where they were elected with roughly 45% of the vote. They were elected to a term and no elections have occurred since. The median age in Gaza is 18, meaning that a majority of those in Gaza were one years old or not even born when Hamas came to power, and there are currently close to one million individuals ages 14 and younger out of the 2.3 million population.

What Hamas did is horrific on a scale that can not be met with anything but overwhelming force, but I fear what will now happen to the close million children being used as collateral. When food, water, and electricity is cut off those most vulnerable will die first, and they are predominantly the children. Ones who had no ability to leave Gaza and did not choose Hamas. On the other side Hamas's leadership is getting what they want while safely hidden away in other countries. They are hoping for martyrs and thousands dead because it will radicalize those left. 

So I don't know what the solution can be. There can be no negotiation with Hamas because this scenario is exactly what they want. There can be no simple turn of the other cheek because they will be emboldened and that spits on the memory of those who have died. There can be no prolonged embargo because hundreds of thousands of children will be starved to death. Gaza, at least independent Gaza, has failed as a concept, and I see no means by which it can be fixed. It will require enormous changes to how Gaza is run at all to be at all functional and not simply a breeding ground for radicalization. 

There is no solution. This conflict is one that will not end, and it will continue to grow worse. I do not agree with the embargo, but do not know what other option there is.","

Trump would childishly and embarrassingly attack people and call people names.  However, it was always directed at individuals in political positions or famous people speaking in a way he disagrees with.

Leaders on the left dehumanize a large chunk of the country, call them deplorables, white supremacists, the biggest threat to the country.
