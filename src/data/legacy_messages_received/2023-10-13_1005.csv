Your approach to research gives away the game. What you are saying without saying is: the intent of social media is to either create outrage or happiness, but mostly to create outrage.

I am not outraged by the DeSantis article. I am not happy with the DeSantis article.

I am simply pointing out an attempt from a publication to create outrage based off of benign comments. This was glaringly obvious to me, and I was successful in pointing this out to others. That was my intent.

Other comments delved beyond the surface of my observation to point out articles like this are created to ultimately influence voters by causing divides in opinions.

My intent with my comment was to prevent such divide from taking place by applying logic, and allowing for expansion from my point based on additional voices, which is important in amplifying a message.

Social media does not have to be outrageous or lighthearted. Social media can be used to diffuse outrage by providing logical observation and facts. 

Your bias is showing in this survey, and that is an example of a poorly executed research model.

Be better.

I would oppose reddit banning r/conservative as I view it as relatively harmless compared to less moderated conservative spaces and view puritanical and muscular progressivism as a threat to an open society. However I do not view the discourse on r/conservative as particularly valuable nor do I think in the grand scheme of things reddit banning r/conservative would make a vast amount of difference in the political landscape. I would put my outrage level at 2.5 and happiness level at 3.  My motivation in participating in r/conservative besides entertainment which would be primary is to do my very small part to win intra-partisan disputes on issues like Ukraine (who I support) or industralism vs libertarianism (to which I support the former) or occasionally environmentalism (which I support). I view inter-partisan fights as largely pointless online as you are either speaking to the choir or just giving the other side an excuse to circle the wagons. The point in participating in these exchanges is to build credibility within the sub and evade bans for heterodox positions. Thats not to say my views are always or entirely disingenuous when posting on inter-partisan disputes. At first they tended to be but overtime I've come to exaggerate my position on issues which I somewhat agree on in a performative way. This is useful in maintaining my conservative flair and evading suspicion of insufficient conservatism granting greater ""political capital"" in intra-party debates. I would add further motivation for this. 

There is a difference between a political and factual truth. I view r/conservative imminent ban as unlikely although possible so in some ways you could view this as deliberate misinformation but that ignores the political truth which is that I do think in the long run that reddit will slowly suffocate right leaning subs for both financial and political reasons. ESG has become a political short-hand for those pressures that will perhaps incomplete or exaggerated is broadly accurate. 

Given that I view puritanical progressivism as a long-term but somewhat existential threat to an open society I view the cultivation of resolve against progressive censorship as a secondary good on this sub. Growing authoritarianism on the left works because it moves slowly and individuals lose little by conformity at each successive stage even if their will to resist would be much greater if taken in their totality. Cultivating resolve in the face of censorship earlier and political mobilization earlier via some degree of threat inflation is useful in cultivating political pressure and countervailing power. You would likely disagree arguing that political radicalization is the bigger threat. I would counter that while political radicalization at its extreme is a negative consequence to such an approach  political mobilization is necessary to combat authoritarianism and a passive right would not be an effective countervailing power. More importantly however I view some degree of political radicalization inevitable from participating in the sub and I view as something of a civic duty to direct political energy away from both delusional targets that waste political capital like stop the steal and away from punching down at other Americans like the poor or gay people and towards targets that are both more politically effective and would lead to a more democratic and moral society like breaking the power of Wall Street so I would place the answer to question 3 at a 5. 

A progressive researcher like yourselves would likely counter that the real threat of authoritarianism is from the right but the reality is that Republicans are both too incompetent and their basic policy positions too delusional to represent a real threat to liberty. The DeSantian ""Counter-Reformation"" may have a limited degree of success in conservative states and that while often distasteful is useful to some extent in preventing political hegemony from arising by the creation of a solid Republican base that will counter progressive drift from education. However there is little national long term threat of conservative consolidation due to their more unpopular regressive social policies and the unpopularity of libertarianism especially in the face of coming automation. The real threat is that when the somewhat inevitable collapse of the Republican Party comes the left could gain power unbounded by democratic pressures. Thus the long-term preservation of society requires introducing ideas for a functional right now. I'm not delusional and don't believe I personally have much impact in that but every man has to do their small duty to achieve an optimal world. 



In the face of a long-term threat earlier mobilization is preferable as it allows the earlier organization of actors and possibly greater time for policy-makers to prepare a response. Furthermore I view the cultivation of resolve against censorship as important for the long term survival of an open society. 







 As to whether I believe that Reddit will ban r/conservative I would probably say yes

Outrage does not describe my feeling at the time, more disdain. I also think most are too desensitised to be outraged. Mild disgust perhaps, not rage.
