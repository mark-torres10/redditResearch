<h3>Subreddit Rules</h3>

<p><em><a href=""/r/politicalhumor/about/rules"">Click for the subreddit&#39;s alternate rule list</a></em></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Posts should be regarding U.S. politics.</strong> </p>

<p>In other terms, if it&#39;s not about American politics or elections, we&#39;ll remove it pretty quickly. </p>

<p>Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, leftists, etc!), but please keep posts civil. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posts should make an attempt at being funny, and should try to include a punchline in the title.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Make an effort with your title:</strong> Try to keep the spirit of the sub and make your title humorous or descriptive.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s isn&#39;t funny (or at least trying to be), we&#39;ll remove it. Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, <a href=""https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor"">send us a message.</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. </p>

<p>2B.  <strong>A social media screenshot that is <em>solely</em> about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor</strong>, and might be better suited for subreddits such as <a href=""/r/CleverComebacks"">/r/CleverComebacks</a> or <a href=""/r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter"">/r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter</a> . Anything that can be described as a &quot;flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn&quot; or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pictures of only text are not allowed.</strong> </p>

<p>Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Images &amp; short GIFs only.</strong></p>

<p>Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.</p>

<p>Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  </p>

<p>Images must directly link to the content you&#39;re posting. Please use Reddit&#39;s image host or <a href=""https://imgur.com/"">imgur</a> if you can.</p>

<p>Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within &quot;allowed&quot; content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.</p>

<li><p><strong>Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.</strong> </p>

<p>Use <a href=""https://tineye.com/"">TinEye</a> or <a href=""http://karmadecay.com/"">Karmadecay</a> and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. </p>

<p>Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.</strong> </p>

<p>The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. </p>

<p>Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a jerk, including use of &quot;tard&quot; or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you&#39;ll be shown the door. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re intentionally trolling, including &quot;google games,&quot; you will be banned. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not brigade.</strong> </p>

<p>Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you&#39;re doing it, you will be banned. </p>

<p><strong><em>7b.</em></strong>  <strong>No &quot;Meta&quot; Posts.</strong></p>

<p>Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub&#39;s comment section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow Reddit&#39;s global rules.</strong> Submissions failing to follow <a href=""https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy"">Reddit&#39;s content policy</a> will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you&#39;re a terrorist, you&#39;re gonna be booted. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>No pointing at offsite resources</strong></p>

<p>Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including <a href=""/r/PoliticalHumor"">/r/PoliticalHumor</a> in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.</p>

<p>This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.</p></li>
