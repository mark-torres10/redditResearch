So, I'm a little confused about how to answer this. You want me to pretend I'm someone reading it instead of the author? 

If that's what you want, then I suppose it would be 7 ?

How would I know whether this person was happy? Again, this is strange because I believe I am the author.

20g0185,8aeco,Griegz,author,"Since this was actually my comment, I think it might slightly invalidate your data if I answer it.  
   
Also, maybe work on your algorithm so it doesn't ask the authors of comments how happy or outraged they think the comment's author was when they wrote it.    

Having said that, I'll pretend it wasn't my comment, and then use context clues to guess that the commenter was being slightly sarcastic and give them an outraged score of 3 and a happy score or 5.  
  
Hope ya'll are having a nice time at Yale.  I hear New Haven pizza is something special, though for me, never having tried it, it really doesn't look too different from NYC.  Apparently, it has a crispier crust.
