20fp37e,6l8kkcmk,Bernsteinn,author,"Hi YaleSocPsych,

I appreciate your outreach and the opportunity to contribute to your research at Yale University. However, I do have a few concerns regarding the design of the questions in the poll. While I support academic research, it's crucial to ensure that the questions are phrased in a way that encourages unbiased and accurate responses. I'd like to provide some feedback on the poll's design:

— It's beneficial to provide a bit more context about the research, its goals, and how the collected data will be used. This can increase transparency and participant trust. As it stands, it's not clear how asking broad questions about one-line posts will yield meaningful results.

 — The questions seem to assume that I felt outraged and happy at the time of the post. It might be more accurate to pose open-ended questions that allow for a range of emotions or even the absence of such feelings.

— The term “outraged” can be somewhat subjective. Including a brief definition or context for this term in the questionnaire might help ensure consistent responses.

I hope you find this feedback useful in refining your questionnaire. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss this in more detail, please feel free to reach out.

Yeah I do.

>Both modern sexism and traditional sexism exerted a statistically significant effect on vote choice in the 2016 election, with modern and traditional sexists less likely to vote for Clinton, even after controlling for other explanations of vote choice. The separate effects of both measures of sexism are evident in Models I and II, and those effects are sustained even when both variables are entered simultaneously in Model III. Indeed, rather than the effects of both measures of sexism being reduced—as might have been anticipated with both measures having some shared variance—the coefficients for both variables slightly increased. In order to show the substantive effects of both variables on vote choice, the final column of Model III shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for each statistically significant variable across its entire range while all other variables are held constant at their mean or modal values.

>The effects of sexism on vote choice—especially modern sexism—was hardly trivial. A respondent with the highest modern sexist attitudes was 64 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.790 compared to 0.145). Traditional sexism's effect did not rival that of modern sexism in terms of depressing the probability of voting for Clinton at the highest levels of sexism, but was nonetheless still notable. A respondent with the highest level of traditional sexism was 43 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.838 compared to 0.420).

>In addition to showing the effect of sexism on vote choice in 2016, it is also important to consider their effect relative to other variables that were noted as potential explanations of vote choice. The final column in Table 1 (∆ Prob.) shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for all of the statistically significant independent variables. It is notable that modern sexism had a larger effect on vote choice than ideology, and rivaled the effect of racial resentment. Indeed, after party identification and racial resentment, no other independent variable exceeded the effect of modern sexism on voting behavior in 2016. While the effect of traditional sexism on vote choice was not as great as racial resentment, modern sexism, or ideology, it did rival the effects of anti‐immigrant sentiment and was slightly greater than that for anti‐illegal immigrant attitudes. Moreover, traditional sexism had a substantially larger effect than either opposition to free trade or economic anxiety.

>It is plausible that the effects of sexism may vary by sex, especially the effects of modern sexism, given that it is more like a measure of resentment toward “uppity women” so that its effects would be more evident among men than women. Therefore, Table 2 presents the results of separate logistic regressions for men and women.

>Table 2 shows that the effects of modern sexism were more evident among men than women, with the coefficient for men over twice the size of that for women, and almost approaching the effect of party identification on vote choice. Indeed, men with lower levels of modern sexism (scores below 0.450) actually had a higher predicted probability of voting for Clinton than women with similar scores. However, as modern sexism increases for men, the predicted probability of a vote for Clinton drops much more rapidly than that for women. Across the entire range of the modern sexism scale for men there was a difference in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton of 85 percentage points (0.921 compared to 0.074). This compared to a 49 percentage point difference for women (0.752 compared to 0.262). At the very highest levels of modern sexism for men, a vote for Clinton would have been exceedingly rare, and a vote for Trump almost a certainty.

>However, the findings of this article do suggest that sexism should not be ignored as one part of the puzzle as to why Hillary Clinton lost an election she seemed on course to win. Sexism—whether operationalized as modern sexism or traditional sexism—was a significant predictor of vote choice above and beyond other confounding variables. Moreover, modern sexism rivaled the effect of racial resentment, with only party identification having a larger effect on vote choice. Both modern and traditional sexism—along with racial resentment and attitudes toward immigrants in general and illegal immigrants in particular—seem a major part of the story in explaining Clinton's defeat, rather than variables that emphasize opposition to free trade, economic anxiety, or anti‐politician sentiment. Moreover, it helps in explaining Clinton's underperformance among white voters both with and without a college degree. These findings further suggest that the argument that Vice President Joe Biden, or even U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, would have been candidates more likely to defeat Trump in 2016 may have less to do with their economic empathy with voters and more to do with them being men. Quite simply, modern and traditional sexism contributed toward many voters being less favorably disposed to a woman running for president than a man who had never held an elected office prior to running for president. Indeed, if the Democratic Party convinces itself that the only reason Clinton lost in places such as the Rust Belt states in 2016 was her inability to articulate an economic argument and appeal to white voters, then it seems destined to be wasting time fashioning an economic message to such voters whose vote was ultimately more influenced by the aforementioned noneconomic factors. 

>As well as offering an explanation for vote choice in the 2016 election, this article also makes a contribution to the broader literature on the role that sexism and stereotyping play when a woman runs for office, especially an executive office. Out of necessity, prior research has been limited to ascertaining support for a woman in a presidential election by utilizing hypothetical matchups, often in experimental research designs. This article, however, used a nationally representative sample in a real presidential election contest to show that a woman running for president against one of the least politically experienced candidates in the history of presidential elections still activated sexism as a short‐term factor in explaining vote choice. Furthermore, the article suggests that sexism may not have been as salient a predictor of vote choice if the identity of the candidates had been different. The findings lend support to the notion that women who run for the presidency will likely continue to face singular obstacles because of their sex.

20ezqj9,3k65oi1r,Chanimuadib,author,"1.  1 I have no idea why anybody would be outraged about this. It was a silly Meme and I tried to point out specific facts on why it was incorrect to do to Human nature.

2.  4 I don't really think this question is applicable, I do not think happy or not happy applies. It's interesting to debate ideas.

3.1 I don't think there should be any outrage over my response. I talked ideas and I did not attack people directly nor their ideas directly I just tried to give them different perspectives on the best way for governments to manage society.

4. 1. I really don't understand the focus on outrage with the way I replied to this topic. I certainly get frustrated on acts saying some of the absurd things people say. I quit reading long time ago due to the fascistic attitude of the moderators. I heard somebody got banned for using the term female, sure enough I went to some subreddit and use the term female and was instantly banned from it. I wasn't outraged just laughed and left.

Also, not nitpick your study, but my primary emotion when writing this post was disgust and disappointment, not outrage, so your net might be too narrow.

You see, some people just like to contemplate things and think, and also like to type.

Don't feel too bad, a lot of anti-intellectual redditors fall into that trap.

I had all that plotted out before I checked your profile.

And now that I have:

https://archive.ph/99eba

Archived in case you decide to purge and try to start over.

>Anonymized direct messaging may decrease polarization

I think you may be of that latter variety from #3, presuming extreme ~~outrage~~ polarization, or something along those lines.

Indeed, it seems that you're fishing for 'polarization' in r/Conservative.  ... Maybe you're just freelancing and trying to use what you think you learned from that paper to get people to be less polarizing?  Maybe you're a leftist going around that sub trying to reach out to people to calm them down or change their minds.

Who knows, I've ran into crazier people PM'ing me out of the blue here on reddit.  Certainly seen a lot of that last, there are a LOT of subversives in that subreddit.

Anyways, from the first line of your first post's link:

>Do anonymous online conversations between people with different political views exacerbate or mitigate partisan polarization? 

That would *always* depend on individual personalities.

There may be an over-all tendency because some personalities participate in such conversations more overall, and combined with the phenomenon where sensationalism or anger generates more clicks, and of course you get more outraged views.

But it's not the conversation occurrence causing that, it is the people involved.

In other words, the premise is flawed.

>Our study recruited Republicans and Democrats in the United States to complete a survey about their political views.

From where?  Based on what criteria?  Why R v D?  What do you think constitutes an R vs a D?  Just how they identify in genera?

That could incur all forms of bias from the staffing/process.

>We found that people who engage in anonymous cross-party conversations about political topics exhibit substantial decreases in polarization compared with a placebo group that wrote an essay using the same conversation prompts.

That seems reasonable if you aren't paying attention.

But right before that:

>We later randomized them into treatment conditions where they were offered financial incentives to use our platform to discuss a contentious policy issue with an opposing partisan. [and blah blah]

So, they knew they were being observed *and* had monetary incentive.  Tsk tsk

And you're(or they if you are not involved with that), trying to say it's the conversation that helped with ""outrage"" and ""polarization"".

If you really want to study the human psyche, I'll offer a similar phenomena to examine.

Say, you sit down with someone that you disagree with, but they're just calm enough to listen to you, letting you do most of the talking, and because it is in person, things kick in such as agreeableness which can short circuit initial obstinance. 

You lay out a factual(cause/effect  as opposed to ""politically correct""[adherence to party doctrine]) argument slowly, starting with very fundamental things and moving from one logical step to another, and they wind up agreeing with you without realizing it.  In other words, you circumvent their normal biases and barriers by starting small with where there is general common ground and walk them gently through the thought process to get where your stance is.

Then, the next day, that same person is out there offering their previous *radical*ly different ideas as if that conversation never occurred.  

When you find that function, you'll be closer to solving radicalism or 'polarization' if you insist.

Good luck with that.

Is that confusing to you?  I'll put it another way:

Say I have a proposition for you.  I want you to sit down and discuss it.  I want to discuss making murder completely legal.

IF you are in complete opposition to the idea, are ""we"" ""polarized""?  No.  

My position would be radical and yours would be acceptable. Any ""Why are you so unreasonable? Why won't you even compromise?"" from me would come off as deranged.

That's part of why the premise and seeming purpose are flawed.

Sometimes there is no compromise.  Sometimes the ""polarization"" comes because one party is normal and the other is already a radical.  Trying to find a ""common ground"" in that situation is what progressivism does.  It seeks compromise, because any compromise is progress.  Then, next week/month/year, they seek another compromise.

That is the compromise treadmill.

Aaanyways.  The podcast I'm listening to is almost over and I've grown bored with this.

I wish they would, but it is not necessarily likely.

I was outraged at the audacity of the centrist pigs then and I'm outraged about the audacity of the centrist pigs now. I did vote for Biden in the interim but that will most definitely happen again and I now have nothing but loathing for Gavin Newsom who I also previously voted for. His veto of the psilocybin legislation turned an ardent supporter and defender into a rabid opponent. That fucking hypocrite sells alcohol for a living. I don't judge him for selling poison but when he turns around and vetoes legislation to legalize psyilocybin --at that point, my blood boils. I see red. I want him out of public office pronto. I'm livid pissed about both Newsom and Biden. They're both pigs as far as I'm concerned but I formerly voted for both candidates. 

As far as how others see my posts, well I have no idea what other people think. Obviously I'm hoping to express my outrage in effort to affect others but I don't pretend to know how they receive my message. I think this is an oddly phrased question because it assumes the person you are asking has a belief that they can imagine what other people think. How would you know such a thing? I would not pretend to imagine what others believe. 

As for what I was thinking about and how I was influenced by the opinions of others on Reddit specifically, I would like to explain that I am a person in my fifties and as an adult I have mostly worked at a college lecturer. To me, when I'm addressing the audience at Reddit, I imagine in my own mind that I am addressing a class of students in a classroom as I do in real life. I'm not here to listen to the opinions of the students, I'm here to let the kids know what the opinions of an adult with an education and some life experience are. So the idea that I'm somehow influenced by the opinions of redditors is far from the case. I try not to be overly pedantic in my approach but ultimately my experience as a classroom instructor is more important in understanding how I address comments to Reddit. I'm here as an editor not so much as a peer of the other users. I assume the majority of them are quite a bit younger than I am and definitely less experienced in an entire range of life skills. 

I'm not here to be influenced, I'm here to give a voice to those opinions which are normally pushed out of the discourse in the mainstream media. The days of influencing my opinions became yesterdays long ago. I'm quite set in my ways.",1697457490.0,"Monday, October 16, 2023, at 07:58:10 PM",d9piei3,"Oh must we? Just voted for Jill.

I was at the time and still am of the opinion that Hilary and the rest of the 'establishment' democrats conspired against Bernie Sanders and that if we did what that article urged... get behind Hilary now that she was the candidate... it would be encouraging future manipulation of the candidate selection process and the democratic process in general as it would normalise it and not punish what is rightly controversial behaviour. Nevertheless, they did this again with the Biden/Sanders primaries when Sanders was winning and the 'establishment' dems had all candidates barr his primary rival drop out before South Carolina and declare themselves for Biden.

I am from Northern Ireland, and we owe the Clintons a debt for their contribution to our peace process... but saying this I'm still of the opinion that they are cold and calculated politicians with quite cutthroat and power hungry behaviour.",1697457169.0,"Monday, October 16, 2023, at 07:52:49 PM",d9po52k,"Interesting that this is coming from The Daily Beast, where Chelsea Clinton sits on the board.
