Yeah I do.

>Both modern sexism and traditional sexism exerted a statistically significant effect on vote choice in the 2016 election, with modern and traditional sexists less likely to vote for Clinton, even after controlling for other explanations of vote choice. The separate effects of both measures of sexism are evident in Models I and II, and those effects are sustained even when both variables are entered simultaneously in Model III. Indeed, rather than the effects of both measures of sexism being reduced—as might have been anticipated with both measures having some shared variance—the coefficients for both variables slightly increased. In order to show the substantive effects of both variables on vote choice, the final column of Model III shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for each statistically significant variable across its entire range while all other variables are held constant at their mean or modal values.

>The effects of sexism on vote choice—especially modern sexism—was hardly trivial. A respondent with the highest modern sexist attitudes was 64 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.790 compared to 0.145). Traditional sexism's effect did not rival that of modern sexism in terms of depressing the probability of voting for Clinton at the highest levels of sexism, but was nonetheless still notable. A respondent with the highest level of traditional sexism was 43 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.838 compared to 0.420).

>In addition to showing the effect of sexism on vote choice in 2016, it is also important to consider their effect relative to other variables that were noted as potential explanations of vote choice. The final column in Table 1 (∆ Prob.) shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for all of the statistically significant independent variables. It is notable that modern sexism had a larger effect on vote choice than ideology, and rivaled the effect of racial resentment. Indeed, after party identification and racial resentment, no other independent variable exceeded the effect of modern sexism on voting behavior in 2016. While the effect of traditional sexism on vote choice was not as great as racial resentment, modern sexism, or ideology, it did rival the effects of anti‐immigrant sentiment and was slightly greater than that for anti‐illegal immigrant attitudes. Moreover, traditional sexism had a substantially larger effect than either opposition to free trade or economic anxiety.

>It is plausible that the effects of sexism may vary by sex, especially the effects of modern sexism, given that it is more like a measure of resentment toward “uppity women” so that its effects would be more evident among men than women. Therefore, Table 2 presents the results of separate logistic regressions for men and women.

>Table 2 shows that the effects of modern sexism were more evident among men than women, with the coefficient for men over twice the size of that for women, and almost approaching the effect of party identification on vote choice. Indeed, men with lower levels of modern sexism (scores below 0.450) actually had a higher predicted probability of voting for Clinton than women with similar scores. However, as modern sexism increases for men, the predicted probability of a vote for Clinton drops much more rapidly than that for women. Across the entire range of the modern sexism scale for men there was a difference in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton of 85 percentage points (0.921 compared to 0.074). This compared to a 49 percentage point difference for women (0.752 compared to 0.262). At the very highest levels of modern sexism for men, a vote for Clinton would have been exceedingly rare, and a vote for Trump almost a certainty.

>However, the findings of this article do suggest that sexism should not be ignored as one part of the puzzle as to why Hillary Clinton lost an election she seemed on course to win. Sexism—whether operationalized as modern sexism or traditional sexism—was a significant predictor of vote choice above and beyond other confounding variables. Moreover, modern sexism rivaled the effect of racial resentment, with only party identification having a larger effect on vote choice. Both modern and traditional sexism—along with racial resentment and attitudes toward immigrants in general and illegal immigrants in particular—seem a major part of the story in explaining Clinton's defeat, rather than variables that emphasize opposition to free trade, economic anxiety, or anti‐politician sentiment. Moreover, it helps in explaining Clinton's underperformance among white voters both with and without a college degree. These findings further suggest that the argument that Vice President Joe Biden, or even U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, would have been candidates more likely to defeat Trump in 2016 may have less to do with their economic empathy with voters and more to do with them being men. Quite simply, modern and traditional sexism contributed toward many voters being less favorably disposed to a woman running for president than a man who had never held an elected office prior to running for president. Indeed, if the Democratic Party convinces itself that the only reason Clinton lost in places such as the Rust Belt states in 2016 was her inability to articulate an economic argument and appeal to white voters, then it seems destined to be wasting time fashioning an economic message to such voters whose vote was ultimately more influenced by the aforementioned noneconomic factors. 

>As well as offering an explanation for vote choice in the 2016 election, this article also makes a contribution to the broader literature on the role that sexism and stereotyping play when a woman runs for office, especially an executive office. Out of necessity, prior research has been limited to ascertaining support for a woman in a presidential election by utilizing hypothetical matchups, often in experimental research designs. This article, however, used a nationally representative sample in a real presidential election contest to show that a woman running for president against one of the least politically experienced candidates in the history of presidential elections still activated sexism as a short‐term factor in explaining vote choice. Furthermore, the article suggests that sexism may not have been as salient a predictor of vote choice if the identity of the candidates had been different. The findings lend support to the notion that women who run for the presidency will likely continue to face singular obstacles because of their sex.

In general Libertarians and conservatives do not like communism because it decreases the standard quality of life. It gives people fewer options in life, name a communist country where people have more freedoms that we do in the United States as a capitalist country? You can't do it. Our country is not perfect but it is far more free than communist countries, so freedom is the key reason we don't like communism. 

There's no such thing as free education or free healthcare. Everything is paid out of taxes which is paid by the people. The concept of government-run healthcare is nice but Name a government that you trust. Do you actually trust United States government to Run Healthcare efficiently and fairly? But doesn't really do anything well now why would they run Healthcare properly? Unfortunately in between jobs I had to get on the Oregon health care plan which is basically Obamacare, while it was free I was embarrassed to be on it and was grateful to get off of it.
