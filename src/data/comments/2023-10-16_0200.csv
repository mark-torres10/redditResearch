If the modern designs we've used tried to replace the M2 of 1919 or 1933, it wouldn't have been a competition at all, the new designs would have vastly outperformed the thing - but new designs have failed to replace the *latest* variants, not the *earliest*. Its not like it came out of the first drawing the perfect gun, or something (to respond to 'just that good')

(As an example, the adjustable headspace in the M2 was originally a design *compromise*: the quality of the mass manufacturing technology a century ago more or less demanded adjustable headspace. You could make a reliable weapon with a fixed headspace given the time to machine every part, in a small production run, but that was just not possible in large-scale production, because the technology on assembly lines meant there was too much part-to-part variation. But modern manufacturing can do away with it, and yet for a long time the M2 was the *only* American infantry weapon with an adjustable headspace, which caused reliability issues not to the design per se, but due to the limitations imposed on training - if its *every* weapon [which was pretty much the case in the 1920s], soldiers are familiar with the concept, but if its unique soldiers are more likely to make mistakes, so it had to be updated).
