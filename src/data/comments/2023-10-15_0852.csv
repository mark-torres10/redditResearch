Fort Worth has a population of 935,508 ( as of 2021) while the city of LA has population of 3.849 million (also in 2021) population size alone should make this argument a non starter. Also notice how the pictures are specifically chosen. A drone picture of a downtown with a river and park. Verses a photo from a random ally looking up. It’s staged outrage BS and should be called out as such.

I’m all for pointing out where things have gone wrong in this country.  But trying to say that Fort Worth is magically better than LA because Republican is just wrong. It’s 1/4 the size of LA. Fort Worth going to be able to be able to do things better because it is a smaller city. Not because it’s red. And by the way they aren’t doing better either. They have their own issues with homelessness and poverty too.

My fear is that a cowardly conservative will get into office and encourage Ukraine to give up land to Russia which is probably as un-American as it gets, people seem to have forgotten how our country was formed… We founded and devolved our colonies by ourselves under British rule while the British contributed nothing, so in 1775 we decided “ya know what we did all the work and built this land, so it’s ours” and the British didn’t like that so they enforced their tyrannical rule upon us. Meanwhile in Ukraine the Soviet Union dissolved 31 years ago and in that time Ukraine has worked and worked to turn its commie blocks into beautiful cities, then in 2014 Russia decided they wanted their sticky hands on that land. Sound familiar? Because it should.

>By now, leading European states (read, France and Germany) must admit that the days when European leaders could pretend that the EU and NATO are always together had ended when the Cold War ended.

>For the United States, surely the easiest way to prevent the EU from becoming a peer competitor is the time-tested golden rule of “divide-and-rule”.

<blockquote>
<p>By now, leading European states (read, France and Germany) must admit that the days when European leaders could pretend that the EU and NATO are always together had ended when the Cold War ended. In post-Cold War Europe, the interest of the EU and that of America often diverge - sometimes fundamentally, and France and Germany cannot continue to pretend that they and America can patch up all the time.<br/>
For the United States, surely the easiest way to prevent the EU from becoming a peer competitor is the time-tested golden rule of “divide-and-rule”. As long as Europe remains divided, America will have one less peer competitor to worry about. Not surprisingly, America has been busy driving wedges among European states.<br/>
If the EU and Russia cannot get Ukraine right; it will be Europe - Russia included - that will suffer the consequences. The result is likely to be a cold peace, if not a new although less ideological cold war. By then, geo-politicians in the U.S., China, and India will have a field day, laughing at the self-proclaimed enlightened Europeans at their stupidity.   </p>

So we’re supposed to protect you against Russia, but they’re paying billions of dollars to Russia, and I think that’s very inappropriate. And the former Chancellor of Germany is the head of the pipeline company that’s supplying the gas.
