What the fuck kind of history books are you reading?!  You need better ones.  Regardless of whatever publicly expressed goals of Reconstruction may have had, it was a series of policies designed to allowing rampant exploitation of the crushed Southern economy by Northern businesses and investors.  And it did exactly that, crushed the Southerners who weren't wealthy businessmen and landowners.  

>Name one true constitutional democracy where collective punishment occurred

Oh, what an obviously dishonest question.  You are moving the goalposts and building into your question a series of assumptions that you can use to weasel out of accepting an answer to the more honest discussion your initial comment opened up.  Your qualifier of ""true"" constitutional democracy is your escape route.  No matter what I answer with, you'll declare the example is not a ""true"" democracy or not ""truly"" constitutional.  And all of that is a distraction because your initial comment was that collective punishment only occurred in dictatorships and communist regimes.  But now if I point to any form of collective punishment carried out by, say, England, you'll say that's a constitutional monarch and not a democracy and therefore it doesn't count.  That you chose to take the conversation that direction is very disappointing.

>Should Palestinians who are non-combatants suffer collectively for it?

Yes, they should, because they are not non-combatants.  They house Hamas's rockets and allow Hamas to stage their attacks in their neighborhoods.  They provide material support to Hamas.  You can argue that they are forced to do so, but the polling numbers showing they want the complete expulsion of Jews from Israel would call into question that conclusion.  

>No it’s a war crime.

So is invading a sovereign nation and killing or ejecting its people.  Yet, that's exactly what the Palestinians want and advocate for. 

>It is that collective punishment that gave the Nazis the ability to put all Jews in concentration camps because some Jews were communists
