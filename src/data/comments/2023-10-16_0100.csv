A) why do you think the ""existential aspect"" is ""more influential"" than a systemic function for a systemic phenomenon (i.e. religion is social and organized)?

How many times have you seen comments like “it was HAMAS not the Palestinians” or seen the snarky correction of “HAMAS terrorists. Fixed it for you” when they are referred to as fighters? </p>

<p>HAMAS is a Palestinian resistance group that has wide support among the Palestinian people. By definition they do commit acts of terrorism. So it boils down to the saying “One persons freedom fighter is another persons terrorist.”</p>

Yes and No.** Terrorism is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

In this sense, Hamas is absolutely a terrorist group, the same way the anti-slavery fighter John Brown was a ""terrorist"", anti-fascist Jewish partisans were ""terrorists"", and so on.

Hamas has attacked the ""civilian"" colonial settlers of Israel.

However, as a matter of international law, UN General Assembly resolution 37/43 adopted in 1982 considers armed struggle against colonial and foreign domination or occupation legitimate, and rightly assigns the crime of terrorism to the military groups created to enforce colonial rule such as the IDF.

I think a more accurate descriptor for Hamas is anti-colonial resistance. The use of the term Terrorist is politically motivated to avoid discussion of the key issue - Israeli colonialism.

**Is Hamas like the Taliban? Yes and no.** The Taliban is a  uniformly far-right Islamic theocratic-nationalist group, seeking to re-establish an Islamic caliphate through the violent deposition of American-backed semi-democratic states.

Hamas is an Islamic anti-colonial group with a mixture of political tendencies that share the goal of ending Israeli colonial rule. It is generally right wing and would prefer to establish an Islamic state, however it's willing to work with the greater Palestinian liberation movement to establish a secular state. In this hypothetical secular state - it would continue to push it's ideology of an Islamic state, but on a democratic not violent basis.

In other words it's pretty damn far right by our standards as socialists. **However**  it's place in the objective historical process is the construction of democracy in Palestine. The Taliban and other ""Terrorist"" groups seek to destroy the limited democracy they have.

From his campaign website:

""Dismantling the Empire

Vastly cutting back on military spending, dissolving non-defensive security alliances, including NATO and AUKUS, dismantling the global network of over 800 military bases and severing the link between U.S. foreign policy and corporate profits to respect national sovereignty and the principle of self-determination for people. The USA should be a decent and dignified nation among nations rather than an imperial power dominating every corner of the globe. Withdrawing foreign aid to Egypt, Israel, and any other countries violating the human rights of subjugated peoples. Increasing humanitarian aid to poor and vulnerable peoples around the world. Enabling international peace by highlighting ecological sustainability, abolishing nuclear weapons, and promoting diplomatic processes.

Unleashing Democracy

Massive investments in satisfying the social needs of everyday people. Medicare for all including humane mental healthcare, decriminalization of drugs, and creation of humane rehabilitation sites. Decent housing for all, quality education for all, free college tuition for all, and jobs with living wages for all. Abolishing poverty and houselessness. Targeting the vicious legacy of white supremacy by ending mass incarceration, demilitarizing policing (abolishing Cop-Cities), and promoting reparations for past unjust treatment of Black people. Prioritizing the empowerment of indigenous peoples. Protecting the reproductive rights of women and ending all forms of patriarchy. Securing the rights of LGBTQ+ and Trans-Peoples. Treating every migrant and asylum seeker with dignity and implementing fundamental changes in immigration policies. Public financing of elections with ranked-choice voting, eliminating the Electoral College and a national holiday for voting. Democratizing unaccountable monopolies and oligopolies with workers' control.""

Unless voting booths are inaccessible to you, which admittedly isn't uncommon at all, national elections barely take any time at all.

Well: let's look at Romans 13 shall we?

According to the writing I have (NKJV) it says, 

""Let every soul be subject to the governing athourities. For there is no athourity except from God and the athourities that exist are appointed by God. Those who resist the athourity resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgement on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil. Do you want to be afraid of the athourity? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same. For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience' sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God's ministers attending continually to this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.

Romans 13:1-7

Now, if we were to take this at face value, we would think it means ""Listen to all authority no matter what."" However: this would actually contradict St. Paul's actions. 

Because according to other parts of scripture such as Acts 22:24-29, Paul himself used the laws of the Romans to get him out of a situation. In which a centurion was ordering for a scourging. Paul basically asked ""Is it lawful to scourge a Roman citizen uncondemned?"" The centurion asked ""Are you a Roman citizen?"" Paul replies ""Yes, I was born a Roman Citizen!""

And even more in scripture such as Numbers it says the daughters of Zelophehad were unable to inherit land according to the law God gave. So Moses went to God and said ""They say this law is unfair, but this Is the law you gave me."" God actually acknowledges their arguement and says ""change the law so they may be able to inherit it.""

Even more: in other parts such as Acts (again) when St. Peter, the leader of the apostles, was given the same vision 3 times where God said ""Peter, stand and kill the animals."" They were all unclean under the law of Moses. And Peter didn't want to go against his conscience. God himself said ""do not call unclean to what is now clean."" 

Ezekiel, in which When God said to cook his food on human dung, said he couldn't under the law of Moses. Moses, who said he shouldn't be sent to preach to the Israelites since he couldn't speak well, and Abraham who said you couldn't destroy the city of Sodom and gammorah for their wickedness because that would go against God's conscience because there are innocent people in the cities (taking the number all the way from 50 to 10 people that are innocent cannot destroy the city.)

Last is the slave thing:

>Literally, slaves obey your master's tells the slaves to do so because material freedom on earth through violent force is irrelevant to eternal immaterial freedom in the afterlife through keeping your head down and praying

This is the same thing as what St. Paul meant in Romans 13.

And even more Yeshua (LHBP) even said ""whoever must be great among you must be your servant and whoever be versed among you must be your slave."" So by definition, this means that ALL are slaves and even more: they're set free according to Luke 4:18-21

And even more: If we were to go to Engels' definition of Socialism, atleast the utopian version had NAMED the early Christian church as proto-socialism (atleast before scientific socialism) or how we would know: Utopian socialism.

<p>I&#39;d also push back on it being inherently monarchist (unless I&#39;m misunderstanding your usage of the term), since most remaining monarchies today aren&#39;t Catholic, they&#39;re either protestant (Europe) or Buddhist (Asia), with Spain being an exception. As for the Pope, you&#39;re technically right, but I know very few average people who worship the Pope as an infallible leader. Most Catholics I know (including myself) rarely even go to church outside of holidays lol</p>

Ethiopia is a great example of how not to organize a religious people. A more striking one is Afghanistan. The edict from the PDPA banning the burqa ended up being the catalyst that began the mujahid counter-revolution which destroyed the country and spawned Al-Qaeda.

If socialism is about liberation, and organizing is about meeting people where they are, we have to understand that ""liberation"" is not universally defined across all people. When the PDPA banned the burqa, the practical outcome outside major, secular cities would have been a total house arrest for religious Afghani women. For them, freedom to wear the burqa was more than symbolic.

The way to challenge existing hierarchies and hegemonies is to provide a better working model.

<p>Ethiopia is a great example of how not to organize a religious people. A more striking one is Afghanistan. The edict from the PDPA banning the burqa ended up being the catalyst that began the mujahid counter-revolution which destroyed the country and spawned Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>If socialism is about liberation, and organizing is about meeting people where they are, we have to understand that &quot;liberation&quot; is not universally defined across all people. When the PDPA banned the burqa, the practical outcome outside major, secular cities would have been a total house arrest for religious Afghani women. For them, freedom to wear the burqa was more than symbolic.</p>

<p>The way to challenge existing hierarchies and hegemonies is to provide a better working model. History shows that religions will adapt themselves to prevailing social opinion much more quickly than an entire population will reject religion based on religious conflict with that prevailing opinion. The texts get reinterpreted when they need to be so the service religious institutions provide will remain relevant.</p>
