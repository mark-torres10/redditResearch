Even after everything that happened. But no doubt these would have to stop at some point in order to actually hit terrorists with them running away. It is a real tragedy for sure.

Here is some context to what happened from the Israeli perspective that I collected and are trying to share for those who are interested:

The death toll now confirmed to be over 1,200. Most of the deaths are unarmed civilians. Many elderly, women, children. There are many more not accounted for.

In some towns the terrorists moved house to house murdering whole families. When they could not get into houses they burned them down, waiting for the residents outside. 

Elderly corpses lying on bus stations face down, some were kidnapped, along with mothers and their babies. Roads filled with cars sprayed down, whole families dead inside. And much more. The horror doesn't end with Hamas.

There are horrible things such as footage of a family where the terrorists have [murdered](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/172x3tj/israeli_mother_covers_the_head_of_her_child_on/) one of the 3 kids in front of the rest of the family and kidnapped the survivors. Endless more similarly horrifying stories.

Parents are still identifying the bodies of their children from videos Hamas took stomping on their corpses. People are [learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/174jys0/imagine_learning_your_relative_died_like_this/) how their relatives died from Hamas uploading pictures and videos of their corpses to their Facebook page.

Hamas is [parading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172hscy/shani_louk_30_yearold_german_citizen_she_went_to/) the corpses of innocent half naked women through the streets. To be spat on by the crazed mob.

There are estimations of some 40+ dead babies [killed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/174ouk4/an_israeli_childs_blood_stained_crib_discovered/) mostly in point blank range. This is only from a single town where the police and military could go house to house and check for corpses already.

Reporters have finally made it into towns and are [describing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/174lgzl/reporting_on_hamass_atrocities_whole_families/) horrible atrocities and non stop finding of bodies in homes.

Yet celebrations are happening all over the world. Both in Palestinian territories like in [Nablus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172ks18/massive_party_today_in_nablus_celebrating_the/) and [Hebron](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172lh9y/palestinian_celebrations_in_hebron_from_earlier/) but also in [Sweden](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/1738nsp/death_toll_over_750_israelis_mostly_innocent/), [Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/17316rq/propalestinians_celebrating_hamass_massacres_of/), [London](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/172u5gu/celebrations_in_london_tonight/), and many [states](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palestinian_Violence/comments/1737cfp/while_death_toll_in_israel_climbs_to_over_700/) around the US.

Not enough evidence gets out. Social media censors it together with mass reports by Hamas sympathizers and a lot of disinformation denying the horrible crimes. We have the evidence, we can't post them anywhere without posts removed or accounts banned. I have some materials if anyone wants to DM me and see Hamas's true face.
