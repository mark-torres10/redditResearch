Nope. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Bank-Rate.asp

Interest rates have been at or below 1% since Feb 2009. Before that, it was 5-7%.

The Boomers are the first and only generation to take more from the state than pay in taxes. They're going to have to suffer some difficult years as social costs will not get paid by the state. Remember the ""Dementia tax""? Hugely unpopular with Tory voters but its coming.

>Besides which, at first glance it seems daft to be spending billions and billions of pounds building railway lines to let people travel faster when fewer and fewer people actually need to travel.

This is incorrect. Infrastructure spending is almost always a good thing for the economy. The only time it isn't good, is when there's too much. Building one bridge over a river is great. People spend less time crossing and can do more work or go to new places and spend more money. Building 100 is excessive and the cost benefits are tiny for each new bridge. 

>Yes, but you're not going to get one through late-stage democracy. We're heading into Aristotle's 'democracy degenerates into tyranny' stage right now.

No we aren't. This is very similar to the end stages of the Thatcher/Major years. They ran the economy down and destroyed the fiscal markets.

The North Sea oilfields are split down the middle and therefore Norway and the UK have extracted roughly the same amount of North Sea oil and gas as each other over the past half century.

However, the UK's population is more than twelve times greater than that of Norway.

Money certainly goes a lot further when you have an order of magnitude more of it to spend per head.

The campaign for Brexit ran on ""saving 350 million a week"" which would be £18 billion a year that is easily covered by how much money an oil fund could have netted the UK. Are you telling me that's insignificant money because the UK has 12x the population of Norway?

It's hard to calculate the economic activity and bump in GDP certain infrastructure projects have since direct correlation is not easy to infer. However there is a general consensus that good infrastructure that makes connections more efficient is always a win long term.

The more a nation gives up on certain projects because of just cost, the more it handicaps itself and has a bigger uphill to climb: something that I am genuinely sad about on behalf of the UK. I am not putting forward this opinion to denigrate, but to lament the choices made.

Just think, the cost for HSR2... like all of the cost, all of it, for the whole project: was estimated to £100 billion. Imagine that, it's less than Norway made for the first 6 months of this year by just investing their oil money back in the day.

As an example, the m4 relief road which is hugely required in South Wales was scrapped time and time again. 

The m4 comes to a halt every time you get near newport and is no doubt a bigger barrier to economic progression than the tolls on the bridge were. 

Yet look at the history of the thing, first proposed in 1991 but rejected by the UK government.in 1999  powers were devolved so Wales could make the decision and 6 years later the project was proposed again as part of a 15 year plan. Fast forward to 2009 (5 years into the 15 year plan) and the project was stopped for the same reason HS2 beyond Birmingham has been rejected, costs had risen £600m to £1bn. The reason the costs went so high in 5 years? Inflation and the Twaite Shad fish and the need to protect it. Instead, they decided to do upgrades to existing infrastructure, just like now. 

They talk and talk and talk more and in 2015 the road now apparently costs well below £1bn.  A year later of more reports and documents, the cost is now £1.1bn and it was included in labour's manifesto to build. More and more reports and recommendations were ordered with a target to open the road Autumn 2021. More public enquiries and talk causes any possible opening of being December 2023 and now the cost is £1.4bn. The removal of the severn bridge tolls massively increase pressure on the road but in 2018 the supportive welsh minister steps down leaving mark drakeford to make the decision, who scrapped it in 2019. 

Just like HS2, people's homes were bought and people were displaced all for nothing. In 2009 the world was struggling just like today with HS2 and its easy at this moment to kick the can down the road. But change in leadership happens and this changes the direction of long term plans. Long term plans should be taken out of the hands of politicians.
