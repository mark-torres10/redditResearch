Are you just spitballing based on gut feeling? Because I guarantee you you’re probably wrong then. I’m aware Hamas is increasingly “popular” among disaffected Palestinians, especially youth. Almost a century of living under apartheid-driven occupation might radicalize more than a few people. 

To be clear, I do not think this action, or pretty much any by Hamas is a good thing. However, contextually, the daily violence and repression experienced by Palestinians have driven them to respond this way. I agree with your point about Palestinian leadership. My point in putting “popular” in air quotes is to indicate that this support is contextual - that many Palestinians under different conditions would not support this, but now feel as if they have been backed into a corner. 

Sociologically speaking, violence often reflects significant unmet societal needs: I think here, the unmet needs are pretty obvious, and are being deliberately perpetrated by an occupying settler colonial state determined to expel or eradicate the presence of Arabs in the region. Last I heard, less than 10% of people have running clean water in Gaza. I’ve even heard people justify this by saying: we’ll Arabs like living in sand and filth (anecdotal yes; but the fact Ben Shapiro is also known for saying this suggests it’s a more widely accepted belief). A peaceful protest by Palestinians a few years ago near the wall in Gaza resulted in something like ~30 000 wounded and more than 200 dead. That doesn’t even factor in the invasion of Al Aqsa, the illegal occupations in the West Bank, and more. It’s fucking gross behaviour you’d expect from Nazis and South African apartheid supporters. 

The point of what I’m saying is Israel is far from blameless in this conflict (as everyone should know). To glibly say that 60% of Palestinians support beating and stripping a woman naked, tying her to a car, and parading her around because generally speaking some Palestinians support Hamas because they feel it’s their only viable option for political independence/liberation is a gross mischaracterization.

Moving onto your point about development: whether or not it is a higher level of development than apartheid is not the qualification for apartheid fun fact. It can still be apartheid and be slightly better conditions than the conditions of South Africa today. Those two are not mutually exclusive. Apartheid is a political concept with actual definitions and tools of repression.

A couple of things:

1. I understand how to use quotes just fine, thx.  Often I'll use them as ironic stressors.
2. ""These people"" might actually be capable (or not) of electing a sane party, if they weren't under continual occupation. But it's absurd to think a people under military rule can do anything in their rational, long-term self interest.
3. Yeah, there IS an actual way to give ""these people"" self-determination.  We did it with the ""uncivilized children"" of the Philippines.  We did it with the ""incapable of having a democracy, unless we bomb them into it,"" Iraq.  We did it with ""Oops, 20yr occupation: time to go--here's the keys, Al Qaeda!"" Afghanistan.  ""We"" even did it with the 1st democracy ever--Haiti--but only if they paid France back for the slaves' lost (which they finally did. In 1945).
4. The point to #3--there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" way to hand over a long, brutal occupation (just ask England!): but it eventually HAS to be done--if you're not a nation governed by mottos like ""might makes right,"" or ""we win: you lose, now die.""
5. These people seemed to govern themselves just FINE (more or less successfully as any other nation), before the Occupation. The Occupation is an apartheid system designed to support Israel, that's it.  The only thing Palestinians' get from it is a loss of self-determination; and a short, miserable life.",1696810862.0,,,t1_k42bq2w,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

The status quo for the West Bank and Gaza are A) A microscopic landlocked nation surrounded by a hostile power with limited/no natural resources, and B) A city-state blockaded on all sides by hostile powers with little to offer the world at all.</p>

<p>This is largely the same reason Jordan and Egypt have never tried to seize Gaza/West Bank Palestine and integrate them - these regions are frankly just not very good places, filled with people who can&#39;t sustain themselves.</p>

WRONG.  Israel blew up their only airport decades' ago: and they've blockaded all exits and access to the sea.  Meanwhile the Israeli tech industry makes a literal killing by developing surveillance technology and exporting it to dictatorships around the world.

Yeah, Palestinians' certainly COULD sustain themselves--if only Israel took its boot if their necks.  To suggest their inability to ""sustain themselves"" is due to 'what kind of people' they are, is about as condescendingly racist at statement as one can imagine.
