Hamas rose to power 17 years ago in 2006, where they were elected with roughly 45% of the vote. They were elected to a term and no elections have occurred since. The median age in Gaza is 18, meaning that a majority of those in Gaza were one years old or not even born when Hamas came to power, and there are currently close to one million individuals ages 14 and younger out of the 2.3 million population.

What Hamas did is horrific on a scale that can not be met with anything but overwhelming force, but I fear what will now happen to the close million children being used as collateral. When food, water, and electricity is cut off those most vulnerable will die first, and they are predominantly the children. Ones who had no ability to leave Gaza and did not choose Hamas. On the other side Hamas's leadership is getting what they want while safely hidden away in other countries. They are hoping for martyrs and thousands dead because it will radicalize those left.

As far as the solution, it's going to be ugly, tens of thousands will die, but I am pretty certain this is what Israel is going to do.

They are going to conquer Gaza. They are going to go building by building, room by room, and hunt down every member of Hamas they know about. They are going to search Gaza top to bottom for every rocket, rifle, and explosive they can find and destroy them. They will find the hostages still alive and rescue them, and recover the bodies of the dead. And they will find and destroy every piece of Hamas propaganda they can find.

They will probably create a parliament of some kind for Gazan's but retain veto power over all legislation, enforce regular elections, and freely ban Islamist 'parties' from participating so the 2006 election doesn't happen again.
