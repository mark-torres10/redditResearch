Lol.

The person I replied to said tried to ""preempt misinformation"" by posting misinformation.

I'm under no illusion that I'd convince the people commenting in these threads to vote Liberal, nor would I try to do that. Pretty well all the top comments I have tags on so I can avoid engaging with them, you included (for your copypastas).

All I'm doing is countering their misinformation.

Normally I'd quote some article to prove every point, but I didn't feel the need to quote [C-311](https://www.arcc-cdac.ca/media/six-reasons-oppose-bill-c-311.pdf) and go on about how no womens rights groups or pro-choice groups would ever endorse the bill and it was only supported by Conservatives and anti-choice/christian groups.

Similarly I didn't feel the need to quote the various ""parental rights"" bills that directly conflict with basic Humans rights, Child rights and LGBT rights.

That seems like common knowledge to me, but I read news, unlike (seemingly) most of this sub.

I did feel the need to quote the article of Bergen with the MAGA hat though, just because that's pretty egregious, and a great example of ""Trumpism"" in the Conservative party.

Remember when she was interim party leader? I do.

I'm open to hearing an argument about how this is misinformation, but you'd need to prove that C-311 isn't an anti-choice bill despite it clearly being one, and you'd need to prove that the ""parental rights"" bills that Conservative Premiers are introducing, and Poilievre is supporting, aren't going to do the thing they explicitly want to do, which good luck, considering Sask had to use the NWC preemptively.",False,,,t1_k51n3ff,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>
