Oh well.</p>

<p>This is a bad law.  It&#39;s based on the illusion of helping to solve crimes, but there&#39;s no evidence to show that it will.  It&#39;s not going to stop the sale of Smith &amp; Wessons or Rugers (cited in other news sources as also ceasing gun sales in CA), it&#39;s just going to stop new, traceable gun sales.  Supply and demand + common sense would suggest that will simply lead to more used, person to person, less- or un-traceable gun sales.  How is this a win for anyone?!</p>

<p>The 2nd Amendment isn&#39;t going anywhere.  There are as many of us on the left who will stand to protect it as there are on the right willing to do the same.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pass sensible gun laws, not more security theater that only protects our emotions.</p>

<p><a href=""/u/Nihla"">/u/Nihla</a>, I&#39;d appreciate your position on this. Do you believe there is a point where an individual&#39;s demands become too much and should be ignored?  If so, where is that point? </p>

<p>I tend to agree with what you&#39;ve said so far, I just want to know how far you&#39;re going with this line of reasoning. Cosby seems to think that, in many aspects, society is already giving the individual too much slack, and while I tend to agree with you that we can do more, I also agree with Cosby that a hell of a lot of individuals aren&#39;t doing enough for themselves. </p>

You realize that just b/c someone's given contraceptives, doesn't mean they'll use them. Likewise, they may not actually be using them correctly - and finally - sometimes they fail. So, yeah, they will not consistently work no matter how many times you use them. There is a statistical failure rate, and that *increases* the more people use them over a longer time.

I think that's the problem - not aiming to do things for yourself, first.  And sure, some can't, so they should be helped, but the problem w/ the sentiment of automatically giving things to certain groups is frankly bigoted and/or racist/insulting as it assumes they're automatically less capable by the mere fact that they're part of said group.

I don't agree that it is.  In fact, I think we're more patriotic, because we're willing to give constructive criticism and we don't wear patriotism on our sleeve.

We recently had bad storms where I live and there was a lot of damage.  Two tree services showed up at my house and both left a card.  One was a local company that had a very normal looking card.  The other one was clearly a travelling group, which is known for ripping people off.

The travelling group left a pamphlet, rather than a card.  The pamphlet was covered with iconographic virtue symbolism, such as the American flag, the Jesus fish symbol and all this other crap that made them easily recognizable as untrustworthy, imo.

In Texas and deep red places, I feel exactly the same as you. The flag has very much become a symbol of the right and drastically so. If you lean progressive you probably don&#39;t put as much stock in symbolism and Nationalism since loyalty isn&#39;t held in higher regard over things like fairness or empathy (see Jonathan Haidt&#39;s research).
