Are you just spitballing based on gut feeling? Because I guarantee you you’re probably wrong then. I’m aware Hamas is increasingly “popular” among disaffected Palestinians, especially youth. Almost a century of living under apartheid-driven occupation might radicalize more than a few people. 

To be clear, I do not think this action, or pretty much any by Hamas is a good thing. However, contextually, the daily violence and repression experienced by Palestinians have driven them to respond this way. I agree with your point about Palestinian leadership. My point in putting “popular” in air quotes is to indicate that this support is contextual - that many Palestinians under different conditions would not support this, but now feel as if they have been backed into a corner. 

Sociologically speaking, violence often reflects significant unmet societal needs: I think here, the unmet needs are pretty obvious, and are being deliberately perpetrated by an occupying settler colonial state determined to expel or eradicate the presence of Arabs in the region. Last I heard, less than 10% of people have running clean water in Gaza. I’ve even heard people justify this by saying: we’ll Arabs like living in sand and filth (anecdotal yes; but the fact Ben Shapiro is also known for saying this suggests it’s a more widely accepted belief).

That doesn’t even factor in the invasion of Al Aqsa, the illegal occupations in the West Bank, and more. It’s fucking gross behaviour you’d expect from Nazis and South African apartheid supporters. 

The point of what I’m saying is Israel is far from blameless in this conflict (as everyone should know). To glibly say that 60% of Palestinians support beating and stripping a woman naked, tying her to a car, and parading her around because generally speaking some Palestinians support Hamas because they feel it’s their only viable option for political independence/liberation is a gross mischaracterization.

Moving onto your point about development: whether or not it is a higher level of development than apartheid is not the qualification for apartheid fun fact. It can still be apartheid and be slightly better conditions than the conditions of South Africa today. Those two are not mutually exclusive. Apartheid is a political concept with actual definitions and tools of repression.

A couple of things:

1. I understand how to use quotes just fine, thx.  Often I'll use them as ironic stressors.
2. ""These people"" might actually be capable (or not) of electing a sane party, if they weren't under continual occupation. But it's absurd to think a people under military rule can do anything in their rational, long-term self interest.
3. Yeah, there IS an actual way to give ""these people"" self-determination.  We did it with the ""uncivilized children"" of the Philippines.  We did it with the ""incapable of having a democracy, unless we bomb them into it,"" Iraq.  We did it with ""Oops, 20yr occupation: time to go--here's the keys, Al Qaeda!"" Afghanistan.  ""We"" even did it with the 1st democracy ever--Haiti--but only if they paid France back for the slaves' lost (which they finally did. In 1945).
4. The point to #3--there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" way to hand over a long, brutal occupation (just ask England!): but it eventually HAS to be done--if you're not a nation governed by mottos like ""might makes right,"" or ""we win: you lose, now die.""
5. These people seemed to govern themselves just FINE (more or less successfully as any other nation), before the Occupation. The Occupation is an apartheid system designed to support Israel, that's it.  The only thing Palestinians' get from it is a loss of self-determination; and a short, miserable life.",1696810862.0,,,t1_k42bq2w,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

I have 3 kids though, so you and your family are going to have to live in a little tin shed out the back. Oh, and I was given a tank to ensure you can&#39;t leave that shed. For security.</p>

<p>And if you are gonna get all uppity about it, I&#39;m going to cut off the power and blockade all food and water from entering. No medicine either.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we&#39;re going to have another vote about the status of your neighbours house aswell. Sadly, you&#39;re going to have to make room in that shed for the neighbours family too!</p>

<p>What&#39;s the matter? We had a vote, <strong><em>you</em></strong> are being unreasonable about this. </p>

<p>Look! One of your kids (or your neighbours kids, makes no difference to me) just threw a rock at my tank, now I have no choice but to blow up your shed. </p>

**They**, you say.

There are nearly 5 million people in Palestine. To treat them as a monolith with singular, simplistic motivations is not useful.

The main massacres and attacks against Jewish civilians were the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre where 39 Jews were killed by Arab workers after Irgun members had thrown a bomb into the crowd and the Kfar Etzion massacre where around 120-150 residents and defenders were killed by Arab irregulars, according to some accounts with the participation of Arab Legion soldiers. The Hadassah medical convoy massacre, with 80 deaths, included the mass killing of medical personnel by Arabs.  
  
According to Rosemarie Esber, both Israeli archives and Palestinian testimonies confirm killings occurred in numerous Arab villages. Most of these killings occurred as villages were overrun and captured during the Second phase of the Civil War, Operation Dani, Operation Hiram and Operation Yoav. Morris said that the ""worst cases"" were the Saliha massacre with 60 to 70 killed, the Deir Yassin massacre with around 112, the Lydda massacre with around 250, and the Abu Shusha massacre with 60–70. In Al-Dawayima, accounts of the death toll vary. Saleh Abd al-Jawad reports 100-200 casualties, Morris has estimated ""hundreds"" and also reports the IDF investigation which concluded 100 villagers had been killed. David Ben-Gurion gave the figure of 70–80. Saleh Abd al-Jawad reports on the village's mukhtar account that 455 people were missing following the al-Dawayima massacre, including 170 women and children.

Well, there's the Naqba, which would be the closest comparison for Hamas.

The commission also concluded that the massacre was a form of genocide.  
  
In February 1983, the Israeli Kahan Commission, appointed to investigate the incident, found that Israeli military personnel, aware that a massacre was in progress, had failed to take serious steps to stop it. The commission deemed Israel indirectly responsible, and Ariel Sharon, then Defense Minister, bore personal responsibility ""for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge"", forcing him to resign

Then there's the time the Israelis sat around while the soldiers they trained committed what the UN described as a genocide in a camp the Israelis ran.

Your chart starts in 1919. I said the early pogroms across the wider diaspora region were in the Ottoman Empire….which ceased in 1919. 1919 is when Britain was in charge of the region.

The other problem with pogroms and Jewish refugees is they came in waves. Once the Levant became a magnet, countries with antisemitic governments would literally go “oh cool we now have a convenient location to expel our Jews to”.
