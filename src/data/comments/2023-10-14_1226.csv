Belgium is also a deeply divided country. Not ethnically but cultural, linguistic, and political. We come from an era where flemish and walloon people hated each other, and there was a lot of discrimination and sometimes violence. 

Like Israel, Belgium is not historically a country but an artificially created one with people who didn't want anything to do with each other. Sure, we didn't have the same levels of violence, but imo that is only because we had 2 world wars to keep us busy, and afterwards, there was only rubble, and no one had the desire for another fight.

Anyway, the only reason we have been able to more or less defuse the situation is by recognizing and later politically defining the borders of the language regions and then keeping them in place. The idea is: everyone stays on their side, and when there are issues, they are resolved on each side, but the border always stays the same.

***Timeline of Jewish ethnic cleansing in Israel***
722 BCE - colonized and ethnically cleansed by the Assyrian Empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_captivity)
 
586 BCE - colonized and ethnically cleansed by the Babylonian Empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity)
 
63 BCE - colonized and ethnically cleansed by the Roman Empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt#Aftermath). Region is renamed Syria Palaestina.
 
628 CE - ethnically cleansed via genocide by the Byzantine empire. Many jews go into exile. https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.22756

638 CE - colonized by the Islamic Empire. Arabs settle the land, with Arab culture, language, and the religion of Islam coming to dominate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Land_of_Israel#Exile_under_Babylon_(586%E2%80%93538_BCE) (see Islamic Rule)
 
1099 CE - colonized, ethnically cleansed, and at times murdered en-masse during the Christian-Muslim conflicts of the Crusades (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora – see Byzantine, Islamic, and Crusader Era)
 
1516 CE - colonized by the Ottoman empire which decreed that Jews could immigrate to and settle anywhere within the Ottoman Empire, except in Palestine. From 1882 until their defeat in 1918, the Ottomans continuously restricted Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine#:~:text=In%201881%20the%20Ottoman%20governmental,and%20land%20purchases%20in%20Palestine.)
 
1917 CE - colonized by the British Empire after the collapse of the Ottoman empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine)
 
 
***A Timeline of Resistance***
Much like other historically tribal people's who were subject to colonial powers, the jews have a long history of resistance against imperial forces, with mixed results.
 
167 BCE - The Maccabean Revolt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt) - Celebrated every year during the Jewish festival Hanukkah - Defeated the Seleucid Empire via guerilla warfare, establishing an independent Kingdom of Judea.

66 CE - First Jewish-Roman War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War) - The revolt lasted 7 years, with more than a million jewish civilians killed in what ultimately ended in a failure to remove the Romans from Israel
 
115 CE - The Kitos War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitos_War) - A rebellion of diaspora jews lasting several years, ending in Judea - estimated 200,000 jews died during the conflict
 
132 CE - Bar Kokhba Revolt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt) - An ultimately unsuccessful revolt against the Roman empire - 200,000 Jewish militiamen killed or enslaved
 
351 CE - Revolt against Constantius Gallus (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_revolt_against_Constantius_Gallus) - A revolt against Christian favoritism and proselytization. Several thousand rebels killed.
 
614 CE - Revolt against Heraclius (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_revolt_against_Heraclius) - A revolt of around 25,000 jewish rebels against the Byzantine Empire in a failed bid for autonomy. Ended in thousands of jews dead and another ehtnic cleansing.
 
1948 CE - Arab-Israeli War (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War)
