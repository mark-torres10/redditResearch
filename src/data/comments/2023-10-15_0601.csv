<p>Honestly, it&#39;s probably best for progressives if the clown show keeps dragging on for a while to generate more negative headlines for the GOP - but at some point soon we&#39;ll need a functional Congress. I&#39;d rather have Cheney than any other name I&#39;ve seen floated - even if she&#39;s only marginally better. </p>

<p>Also, as a bonus, it would piss off the MAGA wing and probably drive a big wedge between the establishment Republicans and the MAGA loyalists - which is the most effective way to bring the whole party down IMO.</p>
