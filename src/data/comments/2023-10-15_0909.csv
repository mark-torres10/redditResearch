1) the mod wing of both parties cut a deal to co-govern.  The left of the dem party doesn’t have as much control as the right wing of the GOP, but I think mods are tired of it and want to show some strength.  So blue dog Dems and whatever the republicans call theirs.    There’s easily 200 Congress people that would be from the opposite party if they moved to a different state.  All those folks.  





2) we get fed some bs about how the parties are uniting because the country is in crisis, yada yada yada.  But it’s basiclly all the corporate funded politicians that have been controlling the government forever. 





3) government “functions” for a while.  Biden gets re-elected.  But in ‘26, everyone in this moderate caucus gets a challenger from their left or right in the primary.  This is cuz they continued to prob up big business and crush the common folk.  We continued to produced poor people at an insane rate like we are now.  





4) one of the parties will fracture.  My money is on the republicans.  The right will split with the mods.  We’re seeing these cracks already.  Mostly it’s because there’s already infrastructure for a real Conservative Party.  Tv stations, operatives, tons of money.  If the Dems split, it’s be labor and left splitting off.  Either way, the “intact” party loses all its mods to the other party.  So now there’s three parties, left, mid/mod, right.  Upper middle class and middle class folks will claim they’re not extreme and be in the moderate party run by rich people.  The right and left will be filled with broke working class folks.  This split is so interesting to me cuz there will be a lot of racial tensions, and economic.  But where will the majority of the lgbtq powers end up?





5) with global turmoil and massive climate issues, AOC will run for President.  Not a normal basic presidential campaign.  But a movement that is meant to sweep her in to office as well as an entire 220+ congressional caucus that will support her.




Either 1 of two things will happen.  A) she wins and we try to save the planet by eating the rich. Or b) some for of mod ticket (former dem + former rep.) wins.  Think…. Mark warner + John kasich.  Either way…
