I'm from Ukraine, my husband is from Russia but he has mixed blood with Ukraine and Indigenous tribes. 

He does not want to go back under any circumstances because of how crap life was there.

My family that lived in Belgorod said surprisingly that their life was better than what it was back in Kharkiv, but that's not really comforting because they were very poor and discriminated against.

There's just so much stigma associated with normal things in Russia to this day. My family ""evolved"" over time and became more westernised but whenever I see someone I know come here from Russia or even at times Ukraine, there's a lot of assimilation that has to happen.

While the differences are stark, I do feel like it is also a huge opportunity to improve quality of life in the ways you mentioned. 

I'd also add:

- stop conscription
 
- close off environmentally unsafe areas

- stop starting wars at all, idk what war is necessary

- let go of the ""Russia is going to take over the world"" mindset and seriously start focusing as you said, on economic prosperity. This is the sad thing about Russia - there are so many highly educated, brilliant minds there but the reputation is so fucked up that nobody trusts anything that comes from there, even if it's good.

- focus on forging close relationships with neighbours and acknowledgement and apologies to countries that Russia fucked things up for 

- get rid of the forced Orthodox religion that's corrupting the country even worse

- actually stop the corruption ffs 

- allow free speech, right to protest, right to criticise the government - monitor it like the NSA but listen to the criticism and think about if it's valid

- stop aiding terrorist organisations and countries 

Basically, Russia would need to be safe, predictable and have a better track record for change than Germany for people like my husband and I to move there. It'd need to be more attractive than Australia. I do feel like as a Ukranian from Kharkiv who speaks Russian, if it became awesome, I'd actually love to go there but to be clear, that would be not Russia as it is today, but the same land, maybe with the language, some of the food & traditional dances / customs that are similar to what we have in Ukraine - but really, pretty much nothing else.
