Their time to build a path to negotiate was really any point between 1981 and now. Nobody forced them to use the Newt Gingrich ""I do not negotiate with anyone outside of my party"" playbook, but they did it anyway. They welcomed it. Until it suddenly turned and bit them in the face once the far-right whack-a-doodles gained a bit of power after the Republican party legitimized them by giving *them* a platform, instead of reaching across the aisle to create something a bit more bi-partisan. 

As a matter of fact, when in the minority, Republicans refused to collaborate the Democrats when they tried to reach across the aisle on healthcare - forcing the Democrats to build it themselves, which was followed by Republicans doing nothing but bitching and moaning about how partisan the bill was - non-stop, for every moment since.
