Point-source capture (which would include ""coal carbon capture) pulls carbon out of a high-carbon source. eg, you just burned a bunch of coal, the exhaust from that has a high concentration of CO2 in it, so you filter the CO2 from the exhaust and store it. Since the concentration is high, this tends to be easier and _relatively_ energy-efficient. Though it can be complicated by dealing with the other stuff in the exhaust. Also, it tends to capture only a fraction of what was emitted, so this is about reducing emissions by XX%, but not pulling pre-existing carbon out of the air.

""Direct air capture"" is sucking carbon out of some random bit of air. The concentration of CO2 there is just the ambient level, which is rather low. It tends to be hard to separate the carbon from everything else, and hence uses a lot of energy. There's really a wild variety of technologies here, from things involving blowers and chemicals to literally powdering rocks and throwing them in the ocean where they will absorb carbon and turn into calcium carbonate (IIRC). Many are energy intensive, which is a potential problem - if the energy comes from fossil fuels then you could end up emitting more carbon to power the process than you extract from the air. _But_ if the energy source is non-carbon-emitting then you can pull pre-existing carbon out of the air, unlike point-source capture.

So, both methods are ""carbon capture"" but they're different things.

Coal isn't _just_ carbon, but burning it does throw some into the air. Burning natural gas, gasoline, diesel, any fossil fuel, will add carbon to the atmosphere.
