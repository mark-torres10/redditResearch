Psyop'd?

You think conservatives are the only party that supports immigration, the ones who constantly attack it. Who's members are known xenophobes and openly call for the end to immigration, just like yourself.

Immigration isn't about us it's about the immigrants, there are people out there who need help, they should be helped.

Here is where you say ""The closest/first country can help."" But that doesn't work for large immigration crisis because individual countries don't have the resources.

We are all needed to help or it will create a domino effect creating more and more migrants as countries become unstable and conflict increases.

Just FYI, I don't care about GDP lines, that's a metric created by the rich to fool people like you into either believing in it or hating it. It's just a number.

You're making a weird distinction here where being part of a given ethnic group is some sort of necessity or prerequisite to being accepted and integrated into that culture. This is not the case. Integration is not predicated on being absorbed into a singular ethnic identity. You can be ""white"" whatever and still live together with other ethnic groups well, and hell even consider yourself as first and foremost part of that country over your parents/your own motherland.

I can show you people who fit this exact hypothetical you've suggested of the ""white British kid"" who are well regarded by Chinese people and who consider themselves to be well integrated with that society and culture to the extent of feeling ""Chinese"".

<p>Personally I have always seen change and evolution as a good thing. Diversity is the food of evolution and will lead to an evolving society. Isolationism never works, isolated societies get left behind because they may not be changing but everybody else is.</p>

<p>And yes many developing countries can have ideas which we find outdated e.g. with respect to homosexuality and equality, but we have laws enshrining these principals. Also what better way to spread our ideas than through closer ties with other cultures.</p>

<p>Interestingly in the UK, the people that I find tend to be the most homophobic and sexist are the ones that would most readily criticize cultural integration.</p>

<p>There are problems to solve with respect to global migration but this approach will never resolve the problem, its backwards looking. Its part of a wider narrative to displace attention away from government failings.</p>

We live in a globalised, technologically-focused society where you can call someone the other side of the world in a couple of seconds.

Telling these people that they're naughty boys and giving them a slap on the wrist for bad behaviour is completely backwards. 

It's like inviting the wolf into your home and then giving it a beating because it proceeds to maul your cat just minutes after being let inside.

You can't just define it in a sentence like a word in the dictionary. The previous comment is bang on - basically every cultural is undefinable in a single, cohesive sentence or two.

Nobody would deny, for example, that Italian culture is distinct, and definitely exists...but try to actually define it. For most people, it would be, more-or-less: ""Pizza and Pasta, red wine, Ancient Rome, football, people using lots of hand gestures when talking, beautiful art and architecture, Leonardo Da Vinci, The Renaissance, close family ties, etc"". Individually, most of those things mean very little, and they're certainly not 'a culture' in isolation. Indeed, they could even be seen as stereotypes, to a degree. But that's sort of the point. Which is why it sounds weird when you try and define/describe it in literal, concrete terms. 

If you did the same for Britain, it'd probably be something like: ""British Empire, WW1 and WW2, Fish and Chips, beer/ale, The Beatles, King Henry VIII, Battle of Hastings, London, the countryside, Roast Dinner, Magna Carta, Rule of Law, politeness and tolerance, railway transport, etc). 

Indeed, both these descriptions of Italian and British culture aren't exactly reflective of the culture as a whole - which is a feeling/vibe, more than anything. But the things that 'spring to mind' about a country and its peoples when you think about it/imagine it, are the direct results of their culture.
