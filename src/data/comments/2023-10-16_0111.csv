https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine


Ideally you want to start at the Ottoman empire 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Ottoman_Empire

Then onto British Mandatory Palestine after the fall of the Ottomans

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine

Then we get the anti Jewish pogroms performed by the Arabs

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots

In 1936 there was an Arab uprising against Britain to stop Jews settling in MP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine


The UK Pulled out due to Irgun bombing the administration in the Kind David Hotel and gave rise to the UN Resolution to split the land

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_insurgency_in_Mandatory_Palestine

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sergeants_affair

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine

Israel declared independence of their part on the 14th May 1948 after the UK pulled out of Mandatory Palestine 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence

However the Palestinians would not accept this partition plan and with the help of the Arab League neighbours invaded and attempted to wipe out all the Jews to take the whole land also on the 14th May 1948

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War

Then in 1956 we get the Suez crisis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis



Then they tried again to destroy Israel  in 1967 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War

They failed so started a War of Attrition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Attrition 

and 73 when they performed a surprise attacked on Yom Kippur 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War


After this there were several attempts at a peace process over several decades

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli–Palestinian_peace_process

In 1987 you had the first Intifada 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada

In 1990 you had Black Monday at the Temple Mount

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Temple_Mount_killings

In 2005 you had the second intifada 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada

This lead to the election win of Ariel Sharon (an Ex IDF General nicknamed the Butcher of Beirut) who implemented the complete disengagement with Gaza, the situation we have today, where all Jews were forcibly removed from the Gaza Strip by the IDF and Gaza were given full autonomy 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza

Soon after the complete withdrawal, rockets were shot into Israel, and a Hamas pickup truck in the Jabaliya refugee camp exploded, killing at least 19 people (both militants and civilians) and injuring 85 people.

Then there were elections and Gaza elected Hamas (an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood) on a policy of destroying the state of Israel and “strives to raise the banner of Allah  over  every  inch  of Palestine” by removing all Jews from the whole land of Israel-Palestine  from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election

https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/880818a.htm

After this Hamas and Fatah (another Palestinian political party who won in the West Bank who are in the PLO umbrella, unlike Hamas) has a disagreement 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah-Hamas_conflict


After all of Hamas’ continued attacks Egypt and Israel implemented a blockade of the Gaza Strip 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip

you also cannot stick purely to Israel, but must also read into the Arab League neighbours and their history with the Jews and Palestinians 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_insurgency_in_South_Lebanon

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt–Palestine_relations

Edit: oh and of course because everyone thinks all the Jews in Israel are from Europe or USA, they actually only make up about 30%, the rest are natively from Israel-Palestine or exiles from the surrounding Arab countries

It's easy to assume that because they have such an advantage in terms of firepower that it would be a straightforward thing to do but recent experiences in Syria would suggest this isn't the case. 

Urban warfare is incredibly difficult and bloody even when the attacker has an overwhelming advantage of weaponry and numbers, particularly when fighting a fanatical enemy willing to fight to the death.

Every causality taken in Gaza will be another death added to the already staggering toll Israel has suffered in the past week, something I'm sure Hamas will be all too aware of.

Previous urban battles in Syria also often came at the end of months-long campaigns to wear down the enemy by which time the US and Russia likely had extensive intelligence on what they were facing. Based on the failure to prevent the initial Hamas assault, Israeli intelligence on what's happening in Gaza would seem to be surprisingly poor.

Perhaps I'm overlooking something, but in my (admittedly completely worthless) view it seems like another recipe for disaster. What will the tolerance be among the Israeli public for further losses?

I don’t think anyone is expecting Hamas to organise any part of it; so for most people it will be a self-help evacuation. 4 miles over rough terrain can be walked in 2-3 hours; some people will get left behind if they can’t physically make the journey themselves. But the unfortunate reality of war is that Israel only needs to attempt to minimise civilian casualties, not guarantee a 100% successful evacuation. </p>

<p>The main questions are whether people will actually try to evacuate (in a practical, don’t take anything you don’t need, don’t take anything you can’t carry, way); and will Hamas tell them to stay and/or try to stop them from leaving?</p>
