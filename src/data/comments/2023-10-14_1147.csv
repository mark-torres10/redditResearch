I don't know that he's saying it's a problem now. It seems that his point is that voter IDs aren't a problem given how much you need an ID in other areas of life.

As for the toilets, it's a complaint about low-flow toilets and may be unrelated to flushing notes.

That's certainly not true. Some people have lost their documentation over the years, often when they have to move a lot or they're homeless. Some children of US citizens are born abroad and their parents never bothered getting documentation for them. They're still US citizens. People fall through the cracks.

Yes it is. Even if they have these people detained somewhere, they don't know for certain what their status is. Often they don't even know where exactly these people came from, so how do they know where to send them back to without an investigation? Maybe they have a legitimate asylum claim.

>Majority of people have certified citizenship I'd

It doesn't matter. Writing laws without considering how it will affect everybody is how you get bad laws. You have to consider the edge cases and account for them, and there are a ton of people in this country who don't have ID, and even if you do have something like a birth certificate or social security card sitting at home in a box or in your parents' basement a thousand miles away, you may not be able to get it when you're held in custody.

>A good chunk of migrants are being held at local government sanctioned facilities.

A good chunk, but the vast majority of migrants are living free in the US.

>And I assume most of them filed for asylum otherwise there is no reason why they need to be held in the US .

Even if they haven't applied for asylum, they need to be held for a while because the government has to prove that they aren't here legally before they can be deported.

Basically: after ww2, the state of Israel was setup as a haven for Jews.  It was placed in the middle east, which was owned by Britain at the time.  A lot of jews moved there.  Since A lot of people already lived there, so there wasn't exactly spare space, there was a bunch of fighting and some of the people living there were displaced.

Since then there's been off and on fighting between the influx of Jews (many of whom were from Europe), and some of the local, mostly muslim population.  There were also some wars between Israel and some of the other countries in the area, who're mostly muslim and didn't like jews coming in to displace their brethren.

At this point it's basically a large scale feud, with lots of 'grievances' each side has against the other.  The palestinians are upset because they were forcibly evicted from their land, and suffered many deaths and losses.  The israelis are upset because they keep getting attacked (in particular terror attacks targetting civilians, since the palestinians don't have the power to fight israeli militarily), and because the history of ww2 made them fearful.

Israel keeps takin gmore and more land from the palestinians, and treatment of palestinians has gotten somewhat worse over the past ~40 years.  It's kinda turning into an apartheid situation, quite a few people argue it arleady is (and not just people you should ignore, but people like former heads of the Israeli intelligence agency).

There aren't really good guys, just bad guys and worse guys.

Yes. Again, where are you getting this from?

The only thing you're mentioning that bears any resemblance to reality is the movement to finally remove the names of Confederate generals from military bases, schools, and other memorials honoring their treasonous battle for slavery. You're surely not arguing that slavery is wholesome, are you?

>Or the islamists in Congress that seem to support every enemy of the United States?

Can you name any? There are a tiny amount of Muslims in Congress, and they tend to be among the most progressive and effective members, doing their jobs well, making things better for their constituents.

They also tend to be the targets of unceasing conservative anti-Muslim bigotry. If you could perhaps present an example of any member of Congress supporting an enemy of the United States? Aside from the obvious insurrectionists, I mean.

<p>The only thing you&#39;re mentioning that bears any resemblance to reality is the movement to finally remove the names of Confederate generals from military bases, schools, and other memorials honoring their treasonous battle for slavery.

<p>Can you name any? There are a tiny amount of Muslims in Congress, and they tend to be among the most progressive and effective members, doing their jobs well, making things better for their constituents.</p>

<p>They also tend to be the targets of unceasing conservative anti-Muslim bigotry. If you could perhaps present an example of any member of Congress supporting an enemy of the United States? Aside from the obvious insurrectionists, I mean.</p>

IMO there's around 7ish clearly identifiable and relevant political groupings in the US, they are:

* Neocons (these guys are much more an elite movement than a popular one though)
* Social Conservatives
* Fiscal Conservatives
* Paleoconservatives
* Progressives
* Working Class Moderates (read: white working class and minorities)
* Technocrats

You can subdivide them further - there's policy differences on things like race between black Democratic moderates and white working class ones for example, but this model is imo ""good enough""
 
Anyways, traditionally the ""mainstream conservatism"" you're talking about, aka [Fusionist Conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusionism) was traditionally made up of Fiscal Conservatives, Neocons and Social Conservatives. The Paleocons were the Republicans' voterbase, but were generally sidelined.

Trump and co. represent Paleoconservatives trying to take over the party. There's a quiet civil war between the Fusionist ""establishment"" and Trump's insurgents. 

However, I think that the war seems to mostly be over. I don't think the GOP will split on those lines, rather Fusionists will slowly get replaced by Trump loyalist Paleocon types.

If a split does happen within the GOP, it'll likely just be 10-20 moderate Republicans from places like New York who realize that their career is toast if their house speaker is fucking Jim Jordan, but even this is fairly unlikely imo

That's why Republicans are so focused on voter suppression.  It's interesting.  Democrat voters are often not inspired and greatly compromise on their candidate. They are a big tent party.  Take Joe Biden.  Nobody was super pumped about him.  He won because of hatred for Trump, not love for Biden. Most people who vote Democrat span a wide variety of political views so it's hard to get someone to please everybody. As we discussed third parties aren't viable, so Democrats are essentially just ""the candidate that's actually going to do *something*'"".   If you had someone far left the centrist Dems wouldn't be enthusiastic.  If you gave someone centrist the far left Dems won't like him.  So this leads to unenthusiastic voters unless you get a real inspirational candidate like Obama seemed when he was running.  A lot of Dems are very critical of corporate America, the system as a whole, distrustful of both the parties and just think the Dems are a better alternative, feel that their voice isn't hard, etc.  So if it's too hard to vote and they have to jump through hoops they might just skip it that year and think whatever, nothing changes anyway.    Where's republican voters tend to fall in line, are nationalists, see voting as their civic duty, etc.  Not to mention many key democratic voters are often minorities and it's easy to disenfranchise them via things like voter ID, laws against people who have criminal records, and so on.  

Republicans are a minority now but the ""land advantage"", skews in their favor.  Gerrymandering has tended to benefit them greater recently because they controlled more state legislatures (and also because democrats dumbly tried gerrymandering reform in places like NY which ended up costing them the majority this past election, but they're trying hard to reverse that right now).  Not to mention that Republicans have control of many federal courts, along with the SCOTUS.   The reason we see so much extremism on the right is because they're clawing onto power using any method possible.  Eventually the GOP is going to need to evolve to keep popular support when demographics changes become too big of a hurdle where the baked in advantages are no longer sufficient to win.  

So yeah I agree that making voting a required civic duty and national holiday will not happen unless democrats have unilateral control.   I don't know if the latter one will even help too much because employers **don't have to give you holidays off**, they just have to pay non exempt workers time and a half.

I think ranked choice voting or approval voting are needed badly to encourage better turnout and kill the spoiler effect, but I'm not sure either party will allow those because the current system benefits both parties remaining dominant.  I personally like approval voting for its simplicity.   States have broad controls over election law so i any change will be very gradual.  

Another solution is to change how representation works instead of doing single member districts.  We could have multi member districts.  Or elect all  candidates at large and allocate representation proportionally.  There is actually some precedent here, as some states used to elect a few reps at largre in addition to mostly single member districts. But this fell out of favor in the mid twentieth century.   

One thing that absolutely need to do is uncap the house.  We are one of the worst represented democracies in the world.  The number of reps should grow with the population, just as it did until 1910.   Smaller districts give better access to your congressperson. It would have the side effect of making the electoral college More likely to follow the popular vote too sense through with me more electors correlated with total population.  

The Senate should be abolished or neutered too, but I think that's a non starter because it would require an amendment.

Essentially the makeup and platforms for both democrats and republicans are about to shift. The thing about these kinds of party systems is that 1 party is usually weaker and has to bend hard in favor of the other side to win power. During the FDR years democrats unequivocally dominated politics as the only Republican to win during that time was Eisenhower who was easily the most left leaning republican to have become president (so much so democrsts even wanted to run him) meanwhile its pretty obvious that post 1964 republicans have dominated as democrats only won with southern candidates like Clinton and Carter or were riding off a massive economic recession like Obama did.

Personally, if you ask me, I think we are shifting to a new political system dominated by democrats where Republicans are going to effectively have to shift hard to the left and what we are experiencing atm is the reactionary right wing anger and frustration at this.

What were are actuslly witnessing is probably anpolitical reallignment. These happen every generation or so where the politicla parties face some kind of massive turbulence that reshapes them and results in a new party system. It happened when FDR got elected and the democrats shifted away from dixiecrats and bourbon democrats that supported laissez faire economics to pro union pro welfare and after FDR pro civil rights. It happened again in 1964 when in the wake of the civil rights act we got the southern strategy and shift towards hardline conservativsm within the republicans.

Gaza is about to be invaded. Hamas hides its resources among the civilian population and does not make an effort to help its people. Israel dropped leaflets telling people to go to southern Gaza, and Hamas responded by telling people to stay home. Hamas actively allows the noncombatants in Gaza to get killed so they can milk their deaths for propaganda value. Hamas does not give a shit about the civilian population of Gaza. This is why their rocket launchers are encamped on hospitals, and not in military bases or somewhere other than the middle of a city.

Israel has strategic goals which need to be accomplished. Because Hamas hides behind the noncombatants of Gaza, this means there is a difficult tug between the two issues of A) how do you kill Hamas fighters and destroy their infrastructure, without also B) not destroying civilian infrastructure. The answer is that if you choose one, you sacrifice the other. For example, Israel gives warnings before it drops bombs on its targets (called roof knocking), giving civilians a chance to escape. This also, however, gives Hamas terrorists in the same zone a chance to escape as well. If you wait too long, it’s true more civilians would get away, but so would the terrorists being targeted. Israel could just as easily not do this, which would result in higher success rates for eliminating targets, but would have higher collateral damage as well. So, Israel gives warnings of different lengths for different targets. Some are long enough for everybody to get away, some not. It’s unfortunate, but how else would they go about taking out the rocket launchers, ammo factories, and terrorist leadership of Hamas?

With regards to the government of Israel, Netanyahu is not a good faith actor. He is beholden to extremists on the right, and if it were left to him alone he would probably just level Gaza and be done with it. That said, there are still restrictions on his power. For one, the Army hates him, and the Generals aren’t about to throw out the entire operational playbook just for him. Two, he is now stuck in a National Unity government with his biggest political opponent, who is a centrist. Three, Israel is keenly aware of media coverage of its conflicts and would like to avoid looking bad. All of this contributes to IDF trying its best to reduce collateral damage in Gaza, but that is very difficult when Hamas hides within populated areas.

The upcoming invasion (which I guarantee is going to occur) can be seen as further evidence of this. Israel could *easily* level Gaza with bombs and obliterate Hamas by simply destroying every structure in the strip. The rockets they hide in their tunnels won’t be of much use to them if every single building in Gaza is gone and they have nowhere to launch them from. Instead, launching a ground invasion will allow for more precise targeting, but also means that Israel is seriously risking its own soldiers. This is a big deal because IDF has become very averse to ground combat in the last few years. Ground invasion means soldiers can physically go in and clear out the tunnels, eliminate terrorists in the street, and physically enter buildings to destroy infrastructure targets (rocket launchers, ammo factories, weapons depots) by hand. The current bombings are designed to soften the territory up (because Hamas is deeply integrated) in preparation for the land invasion. This is absolutely necessary for Israel because going in with no preparation beforehand from air forces means walking into cities with thousands of terrorists hidden in urban structures. Urban warfare is not fun. Rubble warfare is much easier, since terrorists have less places to hide.

With regards to this specific evacuation warning, yes, 24 hours is a short time for 1 million people to move. But that is not the point. 24 hours is an extremely long time for terrorists to set up traps, take up positions in the city, and prepare their defenses. 24 hours is a compromise time between what is strategically sensible (not giving the enemy advanced warnings), and limiting civilian casualties (giving more warnings). It is not designed for 1.1 million people to go south in 24 hours. It is designed for as much as possible of the 1.1 million to get out. Gaza is not that big. Those who are able could probably make it on foot within 2-3 hours. Of course, this is not an ideal scenario since people who are injured or disabled or elderly will have a difficult time, but it is the most that IDF calculated could be afforded. Every hour in advance that Gaza is warned is another hour that Hamas readies for invasion, and more fatalities on the battlefield for Israeli soldiers.

That said, not everybody who remains is going to be killed. Israel is not the Wehrmacht, going through villages and shooting people. Instead, these people will risk becoming collateral damage. Whether from stray tank munitions, Hamas suicide bombers, additional air strikes, or more. IDF is telling those who can get out to do so, and warning those who can’t to prepare. Did Israel get these warnings from Hamas before 1,000 terrorists poured over the border and raped and killed babies, pregnant mothers, and partygoers? Don’t think so. Because of that, Hamas’s attacks were wildly successful in inflicting maximum damage. 1,300 Israelis killed, hundreds taken prisoner, 5,000 wounded. If Israel did the same thing in Gaza last week, I’m not sure Hamas would still exist right now - but neither would most of the people living in Gaza.

It is very difficult to fight an organization like Hamas. It is a death cult which uses civilians as human shields. When the man shooting at you is hiding behind his wife, how do you defend yourself without risking the wife’s life? Hamas actively told its citizens to stay home and ignore IDF warnings. They want their own civilians to die so they can win the media war and turn people against Israel by accusing Israel of war crimes which they, themselves, have caused. 

So the short answer is, yes. Israel acts in good faith. IDF has to weigh strategic considerations against humanitarian ones, and that is an extremely difficult thing to do when the enemy has no regard for human life on either side. In the long run, it is likely more people will be saved by the destruction of Hamas than will be killed in the upcoming war. This is the calculus of Israel, but at the end of the day, Gaza will be a better place without Hamas - despite the likely civilian toll. Hamas had an opportunity to turn Gaza into Dubai when they took over in 2006 (with the people’s support, I might add). Instead, they turned it into one big ISIS training camp. They keep their civilians there to die for propaganda’s sake, while the highest echelons of leadership live in million dollar mansions in Qatar. This is the inevitable consequence of that policy. Gaza can’t even produce its own power, because the money Hamas got which was earmarked towards that goal, was instead used to dig terror tunnels and build rockets.",False,,,t1_k4r5znp,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I have seen some pretty braindead takes, so here is a decent one:</p>
