<p>But consider the flip side:</p>

<li><p>That community is loathe to admit they were wrong about someone. Once someone is part of their “tribe” they rarely ever turn their back on them as long as they can come up with literally any excuse for them. They’ve excused child molesters, traitors, murderers, and more.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump will say “I didn’t mean it when I was insulting evangelicals, I just had to say that because politics, truly I actually am on your guys’ side”. And that’s enough for the vast majority of them. They’ll say “yeah he has to lie sometimes but all politicians do and at least he’s fighting for our side”. </p></li>
<li><p>He got Roe v Wade overturned. As far as they’re concerned, he could murder their entire family in front of them and they’d still be cool with him because that’s how strongly they feel about abortion. </p></li>
