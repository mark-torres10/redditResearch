Treating insulin like it&#39;s all just one simple thing that we can produce for cheap is about as naive and simplistic of a view as you can take on the matter.  Yet, loads of folks in this thread seem to think that insulin is insulin and that $30/vial is somehow better than $35 per 30-day supply (my monthly cost with a $15 co-pay is $105, if I went with WalMart&#39;s option, it&#39;d be over $600 and they advertise $25/vial options).</p>

So when you ask an Indian worker where their family is from or if they’re vegetarian or whatever or discriminate based on last name it’s now plainly illegal.

It seems to me like people wanted to stop this law so they can keep discriminating based on caste.

It’s also not just Indians.

<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Saturday that would have made California the first U.S. state to outlaw caste-based discrimination.</p>

<p>A 2016 Equality Labs survey of 1,500 South Asians in the U.S. showed 67% of Dalits who responded reported being treated unfairly because of their caste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when you ask an Indian worker where their family is from or if they’re vegetarian or whatever or discriminate based on last name it’s now plainly illegal.</p>

<p>It seems to me like people wanted to stop this law so they can keep discriminating based on caste.</p>

<p>It’s also not just Indians.</p>
