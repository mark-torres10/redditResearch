One of the things I've taken away from this election the most is that party leadership matters so much, and that the advancement of craven, immoral people to the leadership of Republican ranks has been absolutely poisonous to this country.

The key thing here is that most people do not care about most issues. They really don't. Most people don't feel that strongly about, well, anything. Especially abstract policies or generic ""corruption"" which doesn't personally effect them. This is a problem with democracy, because you're asking people to make decisions based on issues they neither pay attention to, nor care about. In order for this system to work, the people in charge need to guide their constituencies in good directions. Leadership is not a one way thing - it's not like people say ""we like X"" and their elected officials just do it.

If you had gone back a few years, and asked most Republicans whether they wanted a President who was trying to personally profit off the Presidency, everyone would have said no. And if the GOP leadership - united - says ""this is wrong and unacceptable and the President needs to stop"" it would matter. It would signal to other Republicans that its ok to oppose this kind of stuff.

But the GOP doesn't do it. Either because they are cowed or craven, or because they hate Democrats more than they cared about these principles, they don't do it. And so their base has absolutely no sense that this is bad - it's just another partisan fight. There's no unified, independent sense of ""this is wrong independent of party"". And so even stuff like torture or corruption has really turned into partisanship - Republicans hate corruption by Democrats, don't give a shit about it when the GOP President is astonishingly, brazely, corrupt.

It's not enough to represent people. You need to have some semblance of moral courage. In order for a country to become evil or corrupt, the people don't need to be evil or corrupt.

Serious comment here. If it's a Republican this answer will always be no, regardless of the action.
