No.  He can run as many times as he wants, but he can only win twice.  Technically, if he serves the two terms (Even non-consecutively), he can't run again after that, but that's only after a hypothetical second term, not after another loss.  He can run and lose forever until he gets that second term or dies- if he wants to keep running.  He could even legally run from prison if he winds up there.

The only President ever to be elected to two *non-consecutive* terms was Grover Cleveland.

**Long answer-**

The constitutional limit is that you can only serve two terms.  This was at first just a tradition begun by George Washington, the first President under the present 1789 constitution, who chose to only serve two terms, but then a constitutional amendment was passed legally after Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) was elected to, I think, four terms, in the Great Depression/World War 2 era.

FDR might have been re-elected to even more terms ***if*** he hadn't suffered a bad heart attack or something of that nature during his last term.  He was very popular- credited with both getting us out of the Great Depression and winning World War 2 (Though Truman mopped up in the Pacific after FDR died in office.  Truman is also the one who decided to drop the nukes on Japan.  I'm not saying FDR wouldn't have done it- we'll never know if he would have or wouldn't have.).  We also have FDR to thank for Social Security, though I think in fairness I should at least mention the huge black mark on his record- the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War 2 (Trivia: George Takei, the original Lt. Sulu on Star Trek, who is still alive, had his family interned when he was a child and still has memories of that time.).

To be clear, Roosevelt was well within his legal rights to serve all those terms, because the two term ""limit"" was only a very informal tradition back then, but it is the law now, and a modern President would not be.

The only ways around that are:

\- Pass a constitutional amendment changing the law, which would be virtually impossible in the current political climate because of the high threshold of support it'd need.   It's been a while since a constitutional amendment for anything was passed.

There's a long argument about whether or not the Equal Rights Amendment (for women) was enacted or not, but the short version is that the courts do not recognize it as having been enacted, so it is not functionally law, though some people think the courts are wrong.  It's not relevant to Trump anyhow.

\- Be Vice-President when a President passes away, after which \*I think\* in certain cases, if you're just briefly President under those circumstances, it may not count against the two term limit (But that would probably never apply to Trump- I can't see him running for Vice-President at this point \[Another improbable scenario- if no one gets 270 electoral votes in a Presidential election, I think the House picks the President and the Senate picks the VP, which could result in a Biden-Trump or a Trump-Biden administration (I'm not sure if it's the outgoing or incoming Congress that votes).  I don't think that's ever happened, though.  In order for it to happen, there would almost certainly have to be a third party candidate who wins some states and blocks the leading vote getter from hitting 270, and there's no one projected to be running who could do that right now.  Things can change, but... probably not.\].  And it'd have to be a situation where he hadn't already served a second term as President, like he becomes VP and then is elevated to the Presidency briefly at the end of his running mate's term, and then is allowed to run again.  If he's served two full terms as President, he's not even eligible to *run* for Vice-President.).

\- Turn America in an autocracy or authoritarian state and just ignore the constitution and the law and declare yourself dictator for life, hold an illegal plebiscite where people vote you into office for life, run for a third term even though it's clearly illegal and somehow get on the ballot and get the Senate to illegal receive the electors, or get the Supreme Court to rule against the clear meaning of a constitutional amendment that was solely enacted to prevent that.

Everything under option three would be the end of American democracy and the legitimate rule of law.

&#x200B;

But he can legally keep running until he gets that second term or dies- if he wants to.

President Biden has actually run for President 3 times- 1988, 2008, and 2020 (Though he only ran in the primaries the first two times, failing to get his party's nomination).  2024 will his 4th time running for President.

Jimmy Carter is on only other living one-term President other than Donald Trump and, I guess, Joe Biden, though Biden could still win in 2024 and be a two consecutive term President.  Technically, Carter could run again if he wanted to, but he recently turned 99 years old, was in hospice care a few months ago, hasn't shown an interest in running for anything in 40+ years, and voted for Joe Biden in 2020, so it would be beyond shocking if he actually did it.  He just legally would be allowed to.

I think there are some third-party candidates who kept running again and again in the past, losing every time, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.  Everyone that comes to mind only ran once or twice.  But I just have a vaguely recollection of seeing some people toss their hats in the ring constantly.  I know Ross Perot only ran twice (Random historical note: Donald Trump strongly considered running for Ross Perot's Reform Party's 2000 nomination to the point where he had political advisors mailing free copies of his book to Reform Party activists and was criticizing Pat Buchanan, the eventual Reform Party nominee that year.  Ironically, one of the big things he criticized Buchanan and his supporters for were what he claimed were ties to David Duke.  David Duke endorsed Trump when Trump ran as a Republican in 2016, and when asked by the press if he'd denounced Duke's endorsement, Trump claimed to not know who he was, an obvious lie.  For the sake of clarity, I should mention that Perot wasn't a far-right guy like the people who took over his party in 2000 when he decided not to run.).  I think Ralph Nader and Ron Paul only ran twice, but I could be wrong about either or both of them.

In any event, yes, Trump can keep running until he wins (After which he'd be constitutionally barred from running again), passes away, or gets sick of running.

Realistically, I would think after a second loss, assuming he didn't stage a successful coup afterward, his support would probably drop in every subsequent election he'd lose.  His whole brand is projecting the false impression that he's a winner when it comes to everything he tries.  The more he loses, the more hits that image will take among his supporters and potential supporters.

Your frustration and anger are justified, I'd be frustrated and angry, too, in fact I *am* frustrated and angry just reading your story, but I think we need to be mindful of drawing the line at hate.  
  
Hate is what pushed your transgender patient to try to end their lives, the hatred and judgement they feel directed at them from society, and perhaps hatred and judgement that they directed at themselves, hatred drives people to kill themselves just as it can drive them to kill others.  
  
Your coworker royally pissed you off, and I bet you'd still save their life without a second thought, if you were ever put in that position.  If you told your coworker all of your politics, they might conclude that you're a liberal and that means you hate them, but I bet you don't actually hate them, do you?   Anger, frustration, outrage, sure, but hatred?  I doubt it.  
  
And to bring this all around: Would you have preferred if your coworker had been better educated?  If they'd experienced more diversity of persons and opinions when they were growing up?  That they'd had people who cared about them enough to point them in a better direction, or more persuasive and empathetic voices to pull them away from the hate?  If you're a liberal, there's probably a part of you that sees how the system and society have both failed your patient *and* failed your coworker.
