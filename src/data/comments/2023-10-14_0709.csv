People die not just because they&#39;ve had to wait 34 hours in a waiting room in Canada, they also die waiting to see specialists.  Most people have first hand experience, including myself of this happening.  My uncle died waiting to see a specialist regarding chest pains.  Your wikipedia link doesn&#39;t mean SQUAT when a close friend of mine is a physician in the US, and he complains about his parents who still live in Canada and the time it takes to get an MRI here, versus the time it takes in the US.  The tests, according to him would have been completed in more hours, versus 2 weeks to get them completed here.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find people who think health care is fine as is. Many would love to see the system fixed, if only to make it more affordable.</p>

<p>The problem lies in that those who are for M4A are so loud they not only drown out those with other ideas, but mock those others or worse, insult them.</p>

<p>Not wanting universal healthcare does not make a bad person, or a monster, or a racist, or whatever, it just means I prefer other ideas.</p>
