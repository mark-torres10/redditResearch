On the Taiwan issue, both Washington and Beijing have mostly pursued a policy of deterrence and escalation, engaging in a confrontational action-reaction cycle of hostile deterrence and resolve while showing minimal willingness to engage in credible policies of reassurance. This confrontational interactive dynamic feeds animosity and distrust between Washington and Beijing regarding each other‚Äôs intentions toward Taiwan. 

In order to reestablish a credible level of mutual reassurance Washington and Beijing should adopt the following policies:

‚Ä¢ Washington should unambiguously reaffirm the original elements of its One China policy and place clear limits on the level and type of contact between American and Taiwanese military and civilian officials. Beijing should unambiguously reaffirm its commitment to uncoerced, peaceful unification as a top priority.

We don't need legal repercussions to prevent the action from recurring. 7 year olds shouldn't be driving, and your argument that a parent would let them I disagree with. And if the parent did let them, then it's on the parent to be responsible for them when something goes wrong.

Blind people have the capacity to recognize they shouldn't be driving. They don't need laws to know this. Along with this, mentally disabled people as well. How would they even get cars? Only from someone responsible for them, or responsible enough to (hopefully) realize they shouldn't be selling cars to blind and mentally disabled people.

The same thing that happens to anyone who drives a vehicle, nothing, until something bad happens, and then we determine who is at fault.

I don't think you understand. 

I'm less interested in punishing someone for being a bad driver than I am getting them off the road.
