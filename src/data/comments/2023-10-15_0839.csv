Acting like the GOP was functioning to begin with is absurd. McCarthy was brought in with skepticism. That skepticism turns out to have been well-deserved. 

*Wahhh but the optics look bad!*   
  
The optics always looked bad. 
  
*Wahhh this is a bad way to go into 2024*
  
News flash: we weren't going into 2024 in anything resembling good shape to begin with.
  
With McCarthy we were walking into 2024 being certain failure. Are we going into it in pure chaos now? Sure. But is it certain failure? I'd say no.
  
It's a wildcard, it's drastic, and it's embarrassing in the short term -- but it's a spark of *someone* in Congress willing to pull the fucking pin for once.   
  
This party has been rightfully criticized (especially here) for playing nice, being worried about optics, playing into thr uniparty nonsense, and being shoved around. But once someone actually shoved back, we all start bitching and moaning? Really?
  
It's an insane move, but at least it's a fucking move. It's chaos, but at least it's not coasting into failure.

There was a CR he brought forth that included an 8 percent decrease in spending and border security. Geatz and his crew rejected that and voted for the one we have now which has neither.

- Republicans cut off their nose to spite their face.

- Democrats rewarded McCarthy for reaching across the aisle by helping oust him, thereby assuring Republicans that there is no benefit to bipartisanship.

- Gaetz and the Republicans who voted with him have now helped the Democrats more than McCarthy ever did.

- McCarthy's desperate bid to win the speakership earlier this year was an exercise in vanity that was doomed from the start.

- Republicans can't convincingly attack Biden for incompetence when their own conference is demonstrating historic incompetence. Independent voters notice things like this, and it's not a good look.

- Another thing that would have been a bad look is letting the government shut down days after announcing an impeachment inquiry. Regardless of the inquiry's validity, that would have been sold as Republicans letting partisan BS get in the way of competent governance. McCarthy cleverly avoided that without giving up too much, and now he's been axed for it.",False,,,t1_k3duv19,False,0,"[{""e"": ""text"", ""t"": ""Florida Libertarian""}]",False,"<div class=""md""><p>Takeaways:</p>
