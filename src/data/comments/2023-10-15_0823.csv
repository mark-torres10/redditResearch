<p>From another article:</p>

<p>&quot;Police say they were dispatched to a coffee shop in the city shortly after 1 p.m. for a report of property damage. While there, they contacted a 22-year-old woman who reported that she had just eaten lunch at a nearby deli and was backing her car out of her parking spot when she accidentally struck a Ford Expedition that was across the street.</p>

<p>Police say the woman told them she was not there protesting anything, had no idea whose vehicle she had hit, did not intentionally cause the crash and did not flee the scene. Police say there is no evidence to substantiate the claim that protesters intentionally hit Ramaswamy&#39;s campaign vehicle and sped off.</p>

<p>Both vehicles had minor damage, police said, and the woman received a traffic summons for unsafe backing.&quot;</p>
