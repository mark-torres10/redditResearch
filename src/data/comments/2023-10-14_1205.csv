Democracy is not a goal; it is a means to a goal.   And in this case, it fails.   It fails due to public choice theory.   It is a systemic problem.

There are two ways to solve problems: one is to let each person attempt to persuade others and work voluntarily with them; the other is to gang up and use force against others.

Yeah I do.

>Both modern sexism and traditional sexism exerted a statistically significant effect on vote choice in the 2016 election, with modern and traditional sexists less likely to vote for Clinton, even after controlling for other explanations of vote choice. The separate effects of both measures of sexism are evident in Models I and II, and those effects are sustained even when both variables are entered simultaneously in Model III. Indeed, rather than the effects of both measures of sexism being reduced—as might have been anticipated with both measures having some shared variance—the coefficients for both variables slightly increased. In order to show the substantive effects of both variables on vote choice, the final column of Model III shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for each statistically significant variable across its entire range while all other variables are held constant at their mean or modal values.

>The effects of sexism on vote choice—especially modern sexism—was hardly trivial. A respondent with the highest modern sexist attitudes was 64 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.790 compared to 0.145). Traditional sexism's effect did not rival that of modern sexism in terms of depressing the probability of voting for Clinton at the highest levels of sexism, but was nonetheless still notable. A respondent with the highest level of traditional sexism was 43 percentage points less likely to vote for Clinton than a respondent who had the lowest modern sexist attitudes, but who was comparable in every other way (0.838 compared to 0.420).

>In addition to showing the effect of sexism on vote choice in 2016, it is also important to consider their effect relative to other variables that were noted as potential explanations of vote choice. The final column in Table 1 (∆ Prob.) shows the change in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton for all of the statistically significant independent variables. It is notable that modern sexism had a larger effect on vote choice than ideology, and rivaled the effect of racial resentment. Indeed, after party identification and racial resentment, no other independent variable exceeded the effect of modern sexism on voting behavior in 2016. While the effect of traditional sexism on vote choice was not as great as racial resentment, modern sexism, or ideology, it did rival the effects of anti‐immigrant sentiment and was slightly greater than that for anti‐illegal immigrant attitudes. Moreover, traditional sexism had a substantially larger effect than either opposition to free trade or economic anxiety.

>It is plausible that the effects of sexism may vary by sex, especially the effects of modern sexism, given that it is more like a measure of resentment toward “uppity women” so that its effects would be more evident among men than women. Therefore, Table 2 presents the results of separate logistic regressions for men and women.

>Table 2 shows that the effects of modern sexism were more evident among men than women, with the coefficient for men over twice the size of that for women, and almost approaching the effect of party identification on vote choice. Indeed, men with lower levels of modern sexism (scores below 0.450) actually had a higher predicted probability of voting for Clinton than women with similar scores. However, as modern sexism increases for men, the predicted probability of a vote for Clinton drops much more rapidly than that for women. Across the entire range of the modern sexism scale for men there was a difference in the predicted probability of voting for Clinton of 85 percentage points (0.921 compared to 0.074). This compared to a 49 percentage point difference for women (0.752 compared to 0.262). At the very highest levels of modern sexism for men, a vote for Clinton would have been exceedingly rare, and a vote for Trump almost a certainty.

>However, the findings of this article do suggest that sexism should not be ignored as one part of the puzzle as to why Hillary Clinton lost an election she seemed on course to win. Sexism—whether operationalized as modern sexism or traditional sexism—was a significant predictor of vote choice above and beyond other confounding variables. Moreover, modern sexism rivaled the effect of racial resentment, with only party identification having a larger effect on vote choice. Both modern and traditional sexism—along with racial resentment and attitudes toward immigrants in general and illegal immigrants in particular—seem a major part of the story in explaining Clinton's defeat, rather than variables that emphasize opposition to free trade, economic anxiety, or anti‐politician sentiment. Moreover, it helps in explaining Clinton's underperformance among white voters both with and without a college degree. These findings further suggest that the argument that Vice President Joe Biden, or even U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, would have been candidates more likely to defeat Trump in 2016 may have less to do with their economic empathy with voters and more to do with them being men. Quite simply, modern and traditional sexism contributed toward many voters being less favorably disposed to a woman running for president than a man who had never held an elected office prior to running for president. Indeed, if the Democratic Party convinces itself that the only reason Clinton lost in places such as the Rust Belt states in 2016 was her inability to articulate an economic argument and appeal to white voters, then it seems destined to be wasting time fashioning an economic message to such voters whose vote was ultimately more influenced by the aforementioned noneconomic factors. 

>As well as offering an explanation for vote choice in the 2016 election, this article also makes a contribution to the broader literature on the role that sexism and stereotyping play when a woman runs for office, especially an executive office. Out of necessity, prior research has been limited to ascertaining support for a woman in a presidential election by utilizing hypothetical matchups, often in experimental research designs. This article, however, used a nationally representative sample in a real presidential election contest to show that a woman running for president against one of the least politically experienced candidates in the history of presidential elections still activated sexism as a short‐term factor in explaining vote choice. Furthermore, the article suggests that sexism may not have been as salient a predictor of vote choice if the identity of the candidates had been different. The findings lend support to the notion that women who run for the presidency will likely continue to face singular obstacles because of their sex.

You look at the number of campaign offices he had in red and swing states, the type of negative messaging they were spreading against Clinton.  It becomes more than apparent that his involvement in the election suppressed the vote among rural Democrats, that were being hit with negative messaging against Clinton not only from the right, but then from the left.

Sanders only told his supporters to vote for Clinton after the fact, and had to plead with his own campaign to stop the negative messaging, which they never did...He was entirely unsuccessful at regaining control of his campaign which in large part had become disillusioned and wanted to watch the country burn to the ground around them.

The historical revisionism by Progressives of that election has been extreme, anything to escape political responsibility for the Trump administration. 

And now we are looking at an even worse situation in 2024 with Progressives gaining even more power in the Democratic party.  Pushing unpopular wedge issues that cause more moderate and conservative Democrats in rural areas to bristle.  20 Democrats are up for reelection in the Senate, 3 independents...As a result Democrats are losing control of the Senate.  The Presidential election becomes hard fought simply because Biden is now off message for the demographic he should be appealing to.

You look at the number of campaign offices he had in red and swing states, the type of negative messaging they were spreading against Clinton.  It becomes more than apparent that his involvement in the election suppressed the vote among rural Democrats, that were being hit with negative messaging against Clinton not only from the right, but then from the left.</p>

<p>Sanders only told his supporters to vote for Clinton after the fact, and had to plead with his own campaign to stop the negative messaging, which they never did...He was entirely unsuccessful at regaining control of his campaign which in large part had become disillusioned and wanted to watch the country burn to the ground around them.</p>

<p>The historical revisionism by Progressives of that election has been extreme, anything to escape political responsibility for the Trump administration. </p>

<p>And now we are looking at an even worse situation in 2024 with Progressives gaining even more power in the Democratic party.  Pushing unpopular wedge issues that cause more moderate and conservative Democrats in rural areas to bristle.  20 Democrats are up for reelection in the Senate, 3 independents...As a result Democrats are losing control of the Senate.  The Presidential election becomes hard fought simply because Biden is now off message for the demographic he should be appealing to.</p>

In short, having an animal mascot is one thing, but using a term that refers to an ethnic group takes away from the depth and complexities of their history by hiding it behind a stereotype -- even if that stereotype represents courage and bravery.

Now, it's true that this argument as stated would apply to a lot of other mascots (such as ""The Patriots""), and the reason why those other mascots don't seem to be as important is because currently understanding the depth and complexity of Native American history is important to folks.

Probably because his outlandish behavior has been chiseled into the American psyche for the last ~~two~~ three decades and really isn't anything new. Also, Clinton has to put her money where her mouth is given her stance on so many liberal issues. Trump, on the other hand, is only doing this for Trump. He's essentially desensitized the media (and, by association, the public) to his antics and now people just shake their head and say ""Oh, that Trump!"" instead of getting angry as they would with HRC. A long-term strategy on his part most likely.

>she has enough self control that I don't think it's particularly ""narrow"" for her to avoid making any such extreme gaffe.

Also, Clinton has to put her money where her mouth is given her stance on so many liberal issues. Trump, on the other hand, is only doing this for Trump. He&#39;s essentially desensitized the media (and, by association, the public) to his antics and now people just shake their head and say &quot;Oh, that Trump!&quot; instead of getting angry as they would with HRC. A long-term strategy on his part most likely.</p>

<p>she has enough self control that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly &quot;narrow&quot; for her to avoid making any such extreme gaffe.</p>

<p>Her &quot;fits of anger&quot; could be an issue. But to me, showing anger in this election may help her. Barring any new revelations of criminal activity, the only &quot;gaffe&quot; that will lose her this election at this point is her health.</p>

I agree with that but for different reasons.  Very little attention is paid to her actual words.  Most discussion is meta-discussion about what pundits say about her.  Its a fairly sexist dynamic actually.  Trump, meanwhile, has been allowed to define himself.  And he is pretty deplorable.  The question is whether team loyalty can get republicans to hold their noses and vote for such a noxious person.
