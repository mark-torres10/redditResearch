1. Lying poorly and giving away their intent in an embarrassingly obvious manner is expected behavior. You can't really get outraged at expected behavior, it's like getting outraged at a dog for sniffing poop.

 How happy did you feel on a 1-7 scale? 

Not really applicable.

I really dont care.

RIGHT NOW how outraged are you about the topic you posted about.

    If twice impeached / twice indicted former President Trump keeps attacking our legal systems (to try to deflect his criminal charges and divide America) his supporters may resort to violence again. 

No matter what he says or does? He will go to Court and have the ability to defend himself. Each indictment leads to further verbal word salad and disgusting attacks on the DoJ and the FBI. 

He is beginning to realize that he has to pay the price for his illegal activity. It's expected and warranted.

We are waiting. I have stocked the fridge with root beer and the pantry with kettle corn.

Your approach to research gives away the game. What you are saying without saying is: the intent of social media is to either create outrage or happiness, but mostly to create outrage.

I am not outraged by the DeSantis article. I am not happy with the DeSantis article.

I am simply pointing out an attempt from a publication to create outrage based off of benign comments. This was glaringly obvious to me, and I was successful in pointing this out to others. That was my intent.

Other comments delved beyond the surface of my observation to point out articles like this are created to ultimately influence voters by causing divides in opinions.

My intent with my comment was to prevent such divide from taking place by applying logic, and allowing for expansion from my point based on additional voices, which is important in amplifying a message.

Social media does not have to be outrageous or lighthearted. Social media can be used to diffuse outrage by providing logical observation and facts. 

Your bias is showing in this survey, and that is an example of a poorly executed research model.

Be better.

    DeSantis is a dirtbag and definitely a racist, but as a fan of both sports, the guy is right.  One of the biggest freaks of them all is Jokić. He’s a 6’11” dopey, doughy white guy who moves like he’s 5’7” 130 lbs. and sees the court like he has eyes in the back of his head.  Regardless, 6’6” guys who can jump 40” off the ground are very much statistical outliers. 

There’s lots of reasons to dislike (or even hate) DeSantis. If you start trying to make everything he says into a racist screed, it detracts from the potency when you call him out for the truly horrible things he says and does.  It’s crying wolf.

    **TODAY'S OPINIONS (4 Opinions today - 14 cases remain in this term)**

**Arizona v. Navajo Nation**: Does the U.S. Supreme Court retain exclusive jurisdiction over the allocation of waters of the Colorado River?


""Held: The 1868 treaty establishing the Navajo Reservation reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation but did not require the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe.""

5-4 Kavanaugh decision - Gorsuch dissents along with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.

---

**Pugin v. Garland**: Is Virginia’s offense of accessory after the fact to a felony an “offense relating to obstruction of justice” under the Immigration and Nationality Act?

""Held: An offense may “relat[e] to obstruction of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending.""

6-3 Kavanaugh opinion - Sotomayor dissenting with Gorsuch joining in full and Kagan joining in part.

(Context on this case to cut through the language a bit - A legal immigrant is being deported after pleading guilty to knowingly assisting a felon after they (the felon) committed a crime. The immigrant is arguing that the ""accessory after the fact"" charge is not an ""aggravated felony"" and should not be grounds for deportation.)

---

**Yegiazaryan v. Smagin**: Does a foreign plaintiff with no alleged connection to the United States state a cognizable claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act when it suffers an injury to an intangible property?

""Held: A plaintiff alleges a domestic injury for purposes of §1964(c) when the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate it arose in the United States.""

6-3 Sotomayor decision, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch dissenting.

--- 


**Jones v. Hendrix**: May a federal inmate who did not challenge their conviction on the ground that the statute did not criminalize their activity subsequently apply for habeas relief after the Supreme Court retroactively invalidates the circuit precedent on which the inmate relied in not challenging their conviction?

""Held: Section 2255(e) does not allow a prisoner asserting an intervening change in interpretation of a criminal statute to circumvent the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996’s (AEDPA) re- strictions on second or successive §2255 motions by filing a §2241 habeas petition.""


6-3 Thomas decision, with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson filing dissenting opinions.

(Context: A federal inmate is attempting to get a court to overturn his conviction because the law used to convict him (possessing a firearm as a felon) was overturned by the Supreme Court (individuals have to know they are not allowed to possess a firearm in order for the law to apply). Lower courts are saying he has already challenged his conviction and cannot challenge it again.)

    I thought this was already established? The Mueller report outlines this. Mueller also stressed that Russia is continually going to keep trying to interfere in our elections. Trump supporters got an out from having to face the fact that Trump literally asked them to interfere during a debate with said opponent on live TV. It became more about a massive conspiracy. The MSM ran with that and kept trying to change perceptions to the point it was a win for their base when it was shown that Russia did in fact act on Trumps request.

    A bit curious how people interpreted the 'market economy' question. I was unsure how to answer, as I don't support a 'market economy' as in an economy where market forces are the only/dominant moving force, but I do support markets within an economy constituted of democratic worker co-ops. I just tend not to use market socialist as an identifier as I don't see markets as the sole dominant feature of the future socialist economy

    I have contracted covid 4 separate times.

The second time was the worst. I had a fever for three days and felt like the flu. It did linger a bit, maybe a week or two.

The third and fourth times were a day or two of a headache and never officially a fever, but elevated heart rate, body temp, and felt a little sluggish.

For those of us who are healthy, this was never an issue.

My wife has had all the shots and boosters because her employer forced her to, and she wants them.

She has had covid twice and the most recent infection kicked her ass for two full weeks.

Anecdotal, but when the NYT reported in May 2020 that an estimated 20% of NY state had been infected, we all knew this wasn’t a big deal.

But the propaganda masters worked feverishly, around the world, to roll back democracy and attempted to alienate and imprison those of us who resist.


Recall also, those healthcare workers, and others, protesting against lockdowns and mandatory vaccines were called superspreaders, yet the BLM riots that continued unabated were fine.

Thinking back on all the hypocrisy is maddening.

I would oppose reddit banning r/conservative as I view it as relatively harmless compared to less moderated conservative spaces and view puritanical and muscular progressivism as a threat to an open society. However I do not view the discourse on r/conservative as particularly valuable nor do I think in the grand scheme of things reddit banning r/conservative would make a vast amount of difference in the political landscape. I would put my outrage level at 2.5 and happiness level at 3.  My motivation in participating in r/conservative besides entertainment which would be primary is to do my very small part to win intra-partisan disputes on issues like Ukraine (who I support) or industralism vs libertarianism (to which I support the former) or occasionally environmentalism (which I support). I view inter-partisan fights as largely pointless online as you are either speaking to the choir or just giving the other side an excuse to circle the wagons. The point in participating in these exchanges is to build credibility within the sub and evade bans for heterodox positions. Thats not to say my views are always or entirely disingenuous when posting on inter-partisan disputes. At first they tended to be but overtime I've come to exaggerate my position on issues which I somewhat agree on in a performative way. This is useful in maintaining my conservative flair and evading suspicion of insufficient conservatism granting greater ""political capital"" in intra-party debates. I would add further motivation for this. 

There is a difference between a political and factual truth. I view r/conservative imminent ban as unlikely although possible so in some ways you could view this as deliberate misinformation but that ignores the political truth which is that I do think in the long run that reddit will slowly suffocate right leaning subs for both financial and political reasons. ESG has become a political short-hand for those pressures that will perhaps incomplete or exaggerated is broadly accurate. 

Given that I view puritanical progressivism as a long-term but somewhat existential threat to an open society I view the cultivation of resolve against progressive censorship as a secondary good on this sub. Growing authoritarianism on the left works because it moves slowly and individuals lose little by conformity at each successive stage even if their will to resist would be much greater if taken in their totality. Cultivating resolve in the face of censorship earlier and political mobilization earlier via some degree of threat inflation is useful in cultivating political pressure and countervailing power. You would likely disagree arguing that political radicalization is the bigger threat. I would counter that while political radicalization at its extreme is a negative consequence to such an approach  political mobilization is necessary to combat authoritarianism and a passive right would not be an effective countervailing power. More importantly however I view some degree of political radicalization inevitable from participating in the sub and I view as something of a civic duty to direct political energy away from both delusional targets that waste political capital like stop the steal and away from punching down at other Americans like the poor or gay people and towards targets that are both more politically effective and would lead to a more democratic and moral society like breaking the power of Wall Street so I would place the answer to question 3 at a 5. 

A progressive researcher like yourselves would likely counter that the real threat of authoritarianism is from the right but the reality is that Republicans are both too incompetent and their basic policy positions too delusional to represent a real threat to liberty. The DeSantian ""Counter-Reformation"" may have a limited degree of success in conservative states and that while often distasteful is useful to some extent in preventing political hegemony from arising by the creation of a solid Republican base that will counter progressive drift from education. However there is little national long term threat of conservative consolidation due to their more unpopular regressive social policies and the unpopularity of libertarianism especially in the face of coming automation. The real threat is that when the somewhat inevitable collapse of the Republican Party comes the left could gain power unbounded by democratic pressures. Thus the long-term preservation of society requires introducing ideas for a functional right now. I'm not delusional and don't believe I personally have much impact in that but every man has to do their small duty to achieve an optimal world. 



In the face of a long-term threat earlier mobilization is preferable as it allows the earlier organization of actors and possibly greater time for policy-makers to prepare a response. Furthermore I view the cultivation of resolve against censorship as important for the long term survival of an open society. 







 As to whether I believe that Reddit will ban r/conservative I would probably say yes

    Case in point, go look at r/MarchAgainstNazis. While there is some anti-nazi content there, the majority of the posts are just about Republicans, as if being a Republican is the same as being a Nazi. What's worse, is this is a prime example of scapegoating a group of people by way of propaganda. (Ironically, that's a play straight out of Hitler's Germany). 

Here's how it goes:

Punching Nazis = good/warranted 

Republicans = Nazis

Thus, punching Republicans is good and/or warranted to them, and if not now, it's a matter of time. They would never say it out loud, but lo and behold, they're being primed to think that way as long as these hate subreddits are abused to create further division.

    Guy who has been a lifelong supporter of an explicitly and obviously anti-immigrant political party wonders why they went after the immigrants. Do these people even listen to the rhetoric that comes out of the party they support? Or have they just become so used to democrats protecting them from their own worst impulses that they can't function any more when the democrats no longer have any political power to save them?

This may end up playing out like Georgia's [anti-immigrant law a few years ago, which led to billions in agricultural losses and other negative consequences before it ended up being thrown out as unconstitutional](https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2012/05/17/the-law-of-unintended-consequences-georgias-immigration-law-backfires/)

    \> McCaskill remarked that the breastfeeding “mother’s room” was a “waste of space” and should be replaced with a “room of tanning beds for the guys to tan their testicles”.

Reminds me of the conservative guy on camera scolding his heavily pregnant wife who wanted to use the car, what’s his name? I know these men are trash, but i also cannot understand the mindset of the conservative women who don’t see a problem with their “locker room” talk. Move to Saudi Arabia already why don’t you.

Original comment:

It's against Reddit rules to ban people for participating in other subs, but publicly showing that this happening is what earns punishment?

So it's the whistleblowers that get punished, while the criminals get off scott-free? I guess Reddit _is_ a reflection of the real world.
