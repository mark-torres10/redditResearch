    What about the Cons backing Trump's illegal retention of military and nuclear secrets?!  Anyone saying anything but ""we'll have to see the evidence and trial"" should have their clearances pulled.

    **TODAY'S OPINIONS (4 Opinions today - 14 cases remain in this term)**

**Arizona v. Navajo Nation**: Does the U.S. Supreme Court retain exclusive jurisdiction over the allocation of waters of the Colorado River?


""Held: The 1868 treaty establishing the Navajo Reservation reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation but did not require the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe.""

5-4 Kavanaugh decision - Gorsuch dissents along with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.

---

**Pugin v. Garland**: Is Virginia’s offense of accessory after the fact to a felony an “offense relating to obstruction of justice” under the Immigration and Nationality Act?

""Held: An offense may “relat[e] to obstruction of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending.""

6-3 Kavanaugh opinion - Sotomayor dissenting with Gorsuch joining in full and Kagan joining in part.

(Context on this case to cut through the language a bit - A legal immigrant is being deported after pleading guilty to knowingly assisting a felon after they (the felon) committed a crime. The immigrant is arguing that the ""accessory after the fact"" charge is not an ""aggravated felony"" and should not be grounds for deportation.)

---

**Yegiazaryan v. Smagin**: Does a foreign plaintiff with no alleged connection to the United States state a cognizable claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act when it suffers an injury to an intangible property?

""Held: A plaintiff alleges a domestic injury for purposes of §1964(c) when the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate it arose in the United States.""

6-3 Sotomayor decision, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch dissenting.

--- 


**Jones v. Hendrix**: May a federal inmate who did not challenge their conviction on the ground that the statute did not criminalize their activity subsequently apply for habeas relief after the Supreme Court retroactively invalidates the circuit precedent on which the inmate relied in not challenging their conviction?

""Held: Section 2255(e) does not allow a prisoner asserting an intervening change in interpretation of a criminal statute to circumvent the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996’s (AEDPA) re- strictions on second or successive §2255 motions by filing a §2241 habeas petition.""


6-3 Thomas decision, with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson filing dissenting opinions.

(Context: A federal inmate is attempting to get a court to overturn his conviction because the law used to convict him (possessing a firearm as a felon) was overturned by the Supreme Court (individuals have to know they are not allowed to possess a firearm in order for the law to apply). Lower courts are saying he has already challenged his conviction and cannot challenge it again.)

    I thought this was already established? The Mueller report outlines this. Mueller also stressed that Russia is continually going to keep trying to interfere in our elections. Trump supporters got an out from having to face the fact that Trump literally asked them to interfere during a debate with said opponent on live TV. It became more about a massive conspiracy. The MSM ran with that and kept trying to change perceptions to the point it was a win for their base when it was shown that Russia did in fact act on Trumps request.

    I like his idea of diversity of tactics.

Personally my favorite is laughing at them. Jeering, mocking, clowning on them. It makes them seem like not a threat, feel like not a threat, and shows they are ostracized and unwelcome. Works real good on proud boys and those who like to posture.

    A bit curious how people interpreted the 'market economy' question. I was unsure how to answer, as I don't support a 'market economy' as in an economy where market forces are the only/dominant moving force, but I do support markets within an economy constituted of democratic worker co-ops. I just tend not to use market socialist as an identifier as I don't see markets as the sole dominant feature of the future socialist economy

    I have contracted covid 4 separate times.

The second time was the worst. I had a fever for three days and felt like the flu. It did linger a bit, maybe a week or two.

The third and fourth times were a day or two of a headache and never officially a fever, but elevated heart rate, body temp, and felt a little sluggish.

For those of us who are healthy, this was never an issue.

My wife has had all the shots and boosters because her employer forced her to, and she wants them.

She has had covid twice and the most recent infection kicked her ass for two full weeks.

Anecdotal, but when the NYT reported in May 2020 that an estimated 20% of NY state had been infected, we all knew this wasn’t a big deal.

But the propaganda masters worked feverishly, around the world, to roll back democracy and attempted to alienate and imprison those of us who resist.


Recall also, those healthcare workers, and others, protesting against lockdowns and mandatory vaccines were called superspreaders, yet the BLM riots that continued unabated were fine.

Thinking back on all the hypocrisy is maddening.

    You need chat to the business owners here in  the U.K. that relied on foreign workers from the mainland but at the same time actively supported our exit from the EU. 

Literally business owners who had major exports or imports with the EU backing Brexit SMH. Then afterwards had to shut up shop. 

There are some dumb / shortsighted MF’s out there who are also allowed to vote without engaging their brain or common sense.

    Case in point, go look at r/MarchAgainstNazis. While there is some anti-nazi content there, the majority of the posts are just about Republicans, as if being a Republican is the same as being a Nazi. What's worse, is this is a prime example of scapegoating a group of people by way of propaganda. (Ironically, that's a play straight out of Hitler's Germany). 

Here's how it goes:

Punching Nazis = good/warranted 

Republicans = Nazis

Thus, punching Republicans is good and/or warranted to them, and if not now, it's a matter of time. They would never say it out loud, but lo and behold, they're being primed to think that way as long as these hate subreddits are abused to create further division.

    For what it's worth, I was an active member of a subreddit that got shut down for nonsense reasons. It was an alt sub for a sci-fi show and the mods of the main sub are super progressive.  Because they were bigger and more socially aligned, the admins backed them whenever there were complaints. The Reddit admins will shut down a sub over petty shit like this and not bat an eye.

    \> McCaskill remarked that the breastfeeding “mother’s room” was a “waste of space” and should be replaced with a “room of tanning beds for the guys to tan their testicles”.

Reminds me of the conservative guy on camera scolding his heavily pregnant wife who wanted to use the car, what’s his name? I know these men are trash, but i also cannot understand the mindset of the conservative women who don’t see a problem with their “locker room” talk. Move to Saudi Arabia already why don’t you.

    Edit: I don't know if what I said below is correct. I've read conflicting things on this topic.

Original comment:

It's against Reddit rules to ban people for participating in other subs, but publicly showing that this happening is what earns punishment?

So it's the whistleblowers that get punished, while the criminals get off scott-free? I guess Reddit _is_ a reflection of the real world.
