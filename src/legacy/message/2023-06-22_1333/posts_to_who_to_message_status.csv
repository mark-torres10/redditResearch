Please read.  I an a conservative.  I disagree with you folks on nearly everything. Look at my post history!.
However
I apologize in advance for putting this imagery into your minds, but I really think you should consider this.
No matter what else you might think about Trump, we know how narcissistic and boastful he is.  I think that is undeniable.  Now imagine he gets elected and there is a strong attack on Israel.  And God uses America to rescue Israel.  And then imagine that Trump starts bragging that He is the Savior of Israel instead of giving God the glory.
That is how close we are to having a president with a messiah complex or another Nebuchadnezzar.
Oh, and also he would be able to say how much he has suffered and how much persecution he has been through.  What a suffering savior he has been.  Can you say, ""Antichrist""?  Pray hard people.
This isn't TDS.  If there has ever been _anything_ that liberals anc conservatives, gays and christians could agree on.  THIS IS IT.
Now I would _never_ vote for the party of (D)epravity.
I will be supporting 3rd party presidential candidates, and my rep Jim Jordan.  I am NOT A LEFTIST.
