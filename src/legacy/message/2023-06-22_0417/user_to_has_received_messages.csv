Trump is correct, as per usual, to use this act as a defense.

Senior Attorney Michael Bekesha, a man who lost a case against former President Bill Clinton for taking White House audiotapes when he left office and kept them in his sock drawer, explains Clinton was safe because he was a President who saw it fit to take the documents before his term ended.

""The same is true with Mr. Trump,"" Bekesha writes in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal.

He adds, ""Mr. Trump, like Mr. Clinton, took those boxes with him when he left office. As of noon on Jan. 20, 2021, whatever remained at the White House was presidential records. Whatever was taken by Mr. Trump wasn’t. That was the position of the Justice Department in 2010 and the ruling by Judge Jackson in 2012.""",/r/trump/comments/14fdbgr/trump_is_right_the_presidential_records_act/jozejyk/,1687367136.0,r/trump,"Thursday, June 22, 2023, at 01:05:36 AM",1,0.804122,1,1

Seriously. If this was true why has not ONE SINGLE LAWYER stated this as a defense?

Is the DOJ THAT incompetent that their ENTIRE department failed to note this ""fact""??

He is screwed. Every time he opens his stupid mouth when talking about this in every town hall and interview, he admits to a crime.

His ONLY hope is that the Judge indulges in some probably legal but deliberately obstructive and complicit behavior like preventing evidence being accepted.
