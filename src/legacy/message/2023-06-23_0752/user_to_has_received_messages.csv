**Arizona v. Navajo Nation**: Does the U.S. Supreme Court retain exclusive jurisdiction over the allocation of waters of the Colorado River?


""Held: The 1868 treaty establishing the Navajo Reservation reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation but did not require the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe.""

5-4 Kavanaugh decision - Gorsuch dissents along with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.

---

**Pugin v. Garland**: Is Virginia’s offense of accessory after the fact to a felony an “offense relating to obstruction of justice” under the Immigration and Nationality Act?

""Held: An offense may “relat[e] to obstruction of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending.""

6-3 Kavanaugh opinion - Sotomayor dissenting with Gorsuch joining in full and Kagan joining in part.

(Context on this case to cut through the language a bit - A legal immigrant is being deported after pleading guilty to knowingly assisting a felon after they (the felon) committed a crime. The immigrant is arguing that the ""accessory after the fact"" charge is not an ""aggravated felony"" and should not be grounds for deportation.)

---

**Yegiazaryan v. Smagin**: Does a foreign plaintiff with no alleged connection to the United States state a cognizable claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act when it suffers an injury to an intangible property?

""Held: A plaintiff alleges a domestic injury for purposes of §1964(c) when the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate it arose in the United States.""

6-3 Sotomayor decision, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch dissenting.

--- 


**Jones v. Hendrix**: May a federal inmate who did not challenge their conviction on the ground that the statute did not criminalize their activity subsequently apply for habeas relief after the Supreme Court retroactively invalidates the circuit precedent on which the inmate relied in not challenging their conviction?

""Held: Section 2255(e) does not allow a prisoner asserting an intervening change in interpretation of a criminal statute to circumvent the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996’s (AEDPA) re- strictions on second or successive §2255 motions by filing a §2241 habeas petition.""


6-3 Thomas decision, with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson filing dissenting opinions.

(Context: A federal inmate is attempting to get a court to overturn his conviction because the law used to convict him (possessing a firearm as a felon) was overturned by the Supreme Court (individuals have to know they are not allowed to possess a firearm in order for the law to apply). Lower courts are saying he has already challenged his conviction and cannot challenge it again.)",/r/politics/comments/14g3ly1/discussion_thread_supreme_court_opinions_for/jp3ctp8/,1687442238.0,r/politics,"Thursday, June 22, 2023, at 09:57:18 PM",1,0.6211092,1,1

For anyone unfamiliar, if they rule the clearly wrong way it would mean that voters across the country have no judicial remedy — in state court or in federal court — to fight partisan gerrymandering.

A state party draws a map that gives 80% of the seats to their party on a 50/50 vote? Sucks to be you.  It would allow minority party rule of a state to become basically the norm.

20,20,20,jp4sv3e,MisterJose,t2_83p6l,"So, to read tea leaves: The three outstanding cases from November are the two affirmative action cases, and a due process business case. The judges outstanding for that month are Roberts, Alito, and Kavanaugh. 

Kavanaugh already has 5 opinions. He *could* be writing 7 this term, but if not, his sixth is more likely to come from December. So, it seems strong likelihood that Roberts is going to want to write both affirmative action opinions, possibly as one connected determination, and Alito will get the due process case.

Considering December, as I mentioned Kavanaugh is one of 3 judges left there for the 3 cases, along with Roberts and Gorsuch. The 3 cases left there are the Texas immigration enforcement case, the web designer objecting to being compelled to do work for a same-sex couple case, and Moore vs. Harpur, about state judicial review of state election law. 

None of these are tiny cases, but Moore vs. Harpur is potentially *massive.* So unless it's like a 5-4 where Gorsuch joined the liberals, or a dismiss on smaller grounds, Roberts will probably want that one as well.

In April, Alito and Kagan have yet to write, so good chance one will have the postal worker religious accommodation case, and one will have a free speech vs. threatening statement case. Hard to say which will write which.

This is why you will never convince me that America’s founding fathers had it figured out. They wrote all of our laws with the assumption that all political parties would mostly be playing by the rules, and if not, would be removed. Giving the people no option other than asking their representatives to vote for impeachment is a massive flaw.

We should be able to impeach them ourselves every 2 years when we vote via a simple majority.

And a lifetime appointment is absurd. Demographics change. If you are appointed to the Supreme Court at 40, you could serve for 60 YEARS.
