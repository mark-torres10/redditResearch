>Former Del. Lashrecse Aird won Tuesday's Democratic primary for a seat in the Virginia state Senate by defeating scandal-plagued incumbent Joe Morrissey, a self-described ""unapologetically pro-life"" lawmaker who has long been one of the most conservative Democrats in the legislature.  
Morrissey’s defeat in the reliably blue 13th District outside of Richmond comes months ahead of a Nov. 7 general election where all 40 seats in the upper chamber are on the ballot for four-year terms. Democrats are looking to defend their 22-18 majority under a brand-new map, and they'll be relieved that they'll no longer need to worry about the ever-present possibility that Morrissey could provide a crucial vote for Republican Gov.

A federal judge in Central Islip, New York has agreed to unseal the court records showing the identities of the people who helped Rep. George Santos, Republican of New York, make bond in his federal criminal case.

The court's opinion says the ""the aforementioned documents shall be kept under seal until Thursday June 22 at 12 p.m., during which time defendant may move to modify the conditions of his release, should the suretors seek to withdraw from serving as suretors.""

Santos was released on May 10 on a $500,000 bond, after he was indicted on 13 federal criminal counts, including fraud.
