""Held: The 1868 treaty establishing the Navajo Reservation reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation but did not require the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe.""

5-4 Kavanaugh decision - Gorsuch dissents along with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.

---

**Pugin v. Garland**: Is Virginia’s offense of accessory after the fact to a felony an “offense relating to obstruction of justice” under the Immigration and Nationality Act?

""Held: An offense may “relat[e] to obstruction of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending.""

6-3 Kavanaugh opinion - Sotomayor dissenting with Gorsuch joining in full and Kagan joining in part.

(Context on this case to cut through the language a bit - A legal immigrant is being deported after pleading guilty to knowingly assisting a felon after they (the felon) committed a crime. The immigrant is arguing that the ""accessory after the fact"" charge is not an ""aggravated felony"" and should not be grounds for deportation.)

---

**Yegiazaryan v. Smagin**: Does a foreign plaintiff with no alleged connection to the United States state a cognizable claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act when it suffers an injury to an intangible property?

""Held: A plaintiff alleges a domestic injury for purposes of §1964(c) when the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate it arose in the United States.""

6-3 Sotomayor decision, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch dissenting.

--- 


**Jones v. Hendrix**: May a federal inmate who did not challenge their conviction on the ground that the statute did not criminalize their activity subsequently apply for habeas relief after the Supreme Court retroactively invalidates the circuit precedent on which the inmate relied in not challenging their conviction?

""Held: Section 2255(e) does not allow a prisoner asserting an intervening change in interpretation of a criminal statute to circumvent the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996’s (AEDPA) re- strictions on second or successive §2255 motions by filing a §2241 habeas petition.""


6-3 Thomas decision, with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson filing dissenting opinions.

(Context: A federal inmate is attempting to get a court to overturn his conviction because the law used to convict him (possessing a firearm as a felon) was overturned by the Supreme Court (individuals have to know they are not allowed to possess a firearm in order for the law to apply).
