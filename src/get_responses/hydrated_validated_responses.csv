10,t2_12dsh2mz,,jp0ztf2,I thought this was already established? The Mueller report outlines this. Mueller also stressed that Russia is continually going to keep trying to interfere in our elections. Trump supporters got an out from having to face the fact that Trump literally asked them to interfere during a debate with said opponent on live TV. It became more about a massive conspiracy. The MSM ran with that and kept trying to change perceptions to the point it was a win for their base when it was shown that Russia did in fact act on Trumps request.,/r/politics/comments/14fj0lj/adam_schiff_gets_john_durham_to_admit_russia/jp0ztf2/,"Thursday, June 22, 2023, at 07:36:34 AM",0,r/politics
