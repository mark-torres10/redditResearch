# Source Code

Most of the code lives here.

## `sync`
This section of the code manages syncing data from Reddit. It takes as input a given subreddit as well as how many threads to sync from the subreddit and how many comments to sync per thread.

## `ml`
Once the comments are synced, we classify the comments as having outrage or not.

# TODO: update other sections.
