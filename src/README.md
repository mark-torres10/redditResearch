# Source Code

## Sections
Most of the code lives here. Each folder contains a certain section of the data collection logic. In order, they are:

### `sync`
This section of the code manages syncing data from Reddit. It takes as input a given subreddit as well as how many threads to sync from the subreddit and how many comments to sync per thread.

### `ml`
Once the comments are synced, we classify the comments as having outrage or not.

# TODO: update other sections.
