The state Supreme Court will lean liberal starting in August, and there will likely be a lawsuit challenging the gerrymandered maps, so hopefully that will change and we will have an electorate more representative of the peoples' votes. As for the US Senate seat, the democratic challenger ran a poor campaign last fall and the republican incumbent eeked out a victory using an incredibly racist and negative campaign.
