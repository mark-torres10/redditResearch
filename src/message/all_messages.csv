59,jovtx7r,t2_tg1ieqhk,"Here's a preview of the story: 

A federal judge in Central Islip, New York has agreed to unseal the court records showing the identities of the people who helped Rep. George Santos, Republican of New York, make bond in his federal criminal case.

The court's opinion says the ""the aforementioned documents shall be kept under seal until Thursday June 22 at 12 p.m., during which time defendant may move to modify the conditions of his release, should the suretors seek to withdraw from serving as suretors.""

Santos was released on May 10 on a $500,000 bond, after he was indicted on 13 federal criminal counts, including fraud.

It's doubtful they'll receive any threats.  George Santos is really a symptom of Republican insanity, but he doesn't have any power or influence.  His only value is that he's a live body that can vote on GOP issues.  

Yes, Democrats are angry that Santos continues to serve, but I doubt any one of us will try to physically hurt the people who bailed him out.",/r/politics/comments/14ensxe/judge_to_unseal_identities_of_3_people_who_backed/jovx5ez/,"Wednesday, June 21, 2023, at 05:50:25 AM",1,r/politics

""Held: The 1868 treaty establishing the Navajo Reservation reserved necessary water to accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation but did not require the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe.""

5-4 Kavanaugh decision - Gorsuch dissents along with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.

---

**Pugin v. Garland**: Is Virginia’s offense of accessory after the fact to a felony an “offense relating to obstruction of justice” under the Immigration and Nationality Act?

""Held: An offense may “relat[e] to obstruction of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending.""

6-3 Kavanaugh opinion - Sotomayor dissenting with Gorsuch joining in full and Kagan joining in part.

(Context on this case to cut through the language a bit - A legal immigrant is being deported after pleading guilty to knowingly assisting a felon after they (the felon) committed a crime. The immigrant is arguing that the ""accessory after the fact"" charge is not an ""aggravated felony"" and should not be grounds for deportation.)

---

**Yegiazaryan v. Smagin**: Does a foreign plaintiff with no alleged connection to the United States state a cognizable claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act when it suffers an injury to an intangible property?

""Held: A plaintiff alleges a domestic injury for purposes of §1964(c) when the circumstances surrounding the injury indicate it arose in the United States.""

6-3 Sotomayor decision, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch dissenting.

--- 


**Jones v. Hendrix**: May a federal inmate who did not challenge their conviction on the ground that the statute did not criminalize their activity subsequently apply for habeas relief after the Supreme Court retroactively invalidates the circuit precedent on which the inmate relied in not challenging their conviction?

""Held: Section 2255(e) does not allow a prisoner asserting an intervening change in interpretation of a criminal statute to circumvent the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996’s (AEDPA) re- strictions on second or successive §2255 motions by filing a §2241 habeas petition.""


6-3 Thomas decision, with Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson filing dissenting opinions.

(Context: A federal inmate is attempting to get a court to overturn his conviction because the law used to convict him (possessing a firearm as a felon) was overturned by the Supreme Court (individuals have to know they are not allowed to possess a firearm in order for the law to apply). Lower courts are saying he has already challenged his conviction and cannot challenge it again.)",/r/politics/comments/14g3ly1/discussion_thread_supreme_court_opinions_for/jp3ctp8/,"Thursday, June 22, 2023, at 09:57:18 PM",1,r/politics

A state party draws a map that gives 80% of the seats to their party on a 50/50 vote? Sucks to be you.  It would allow minority party rule of a state to become basically the norm.

277,jp4sv3e,t2_83p6l,"So, to read tea leaves: The three outstanding cases from November are the two affirmative action cases, and a due process business case. The judges outstanding for that month are Roberts, Alito, and Kavanaugh. 

Kavanaugh already has 5 opinions. He *could* be writing 7 this term, but if not, his sixth is more likely to come from December. So, it seems strong likelihood that Roberts is going to want to write both affirmative action opinions, possibly as one connected determination, and Alito will get the due process case.

Considering December, as I mentioned Kavanaugh is one of 3 judges left there for the 3 cases, along with Roberts and Gorsuch. The 3 cases left there are the Texas immigration enforcement case, the web designer objecting to being compelled to do work for a same-sex couple case, and Moore vs. Harpur, about state judicial review of state election law. 

None of these are tiny cases, but Moore vs. Harpur is potentially *massive.* So unless it's like a 5-4 where Gorsuch joined the liberals, or a dismiss on smaller grounds, Roberts will probably want that one as well.

In April, Alito and Kagan have yet to write, so good chance one will have the postal worker religious accommodation case, and one will have a free speech vs. threatening statement case. Hard to say which will write which.

Giving the people no option other than asking their representatives to vote for impeachment is a massive flaw.

We should be able to impeach them ourselves every 2 years when we vote via a simple majority.

The observations by MTW here and in the prior post reinforce my view that Judge Cannon might actually be as good a draw as one could hope for, in these circumstances. Jack Smith obviously would have thought through the nuances of the assignment wheel in SD Fla, knowing that there was a very high chance Judge Cannon would get the case. And the way Smith did this retains a lot of optionality about the charges. As much as could be retained while wanting to avoid the venue dispute if he had taken this to DC.

First, if the case drew anyone other than Judge Cannon, Trump would be hammering away on the judge already. He’s got his best choice, and if/when Judge Cannon makes any rulings against Trump, it will reinforce the legitimacy of Smith inside the Beltway press corps. If Judge Cannon rules in favor of Trump, Smith has the best possible chance of CA11 viewing her as making an error, after the special master nonsense, compared to any other judge. Everything is going up on appeal so this gives Smith the best chances.

All this matters a lot. Trump will still turn on Judge Cannon and complain, but it will matter with speed of appellate and trial process. And legitimacy inside DC.

Sure, Judge Cannon can shade jury selection to maximize chances of a mistrial, without any practical risk of appeal. But the E Jean Carroll jury having a MAGA and still unanimously convicting says there is probably my better. By the time it gets to jury selection in SD Fla, Smith will have indicted on Jan 6 (at least by now Smith knows whether he will have that card to play). After a strong Jan 6 indictment, a mistrial in Florida will not be seen broadly as acquittal (even if Trump claims it), but rather as MAGA holdout.

But as MTW pointed out in an earlier post (labeling this a tactical nuc and calling it the “Mar-a-Lago Indictment” to distinguish from other future possibilities). Smith has likely preserved that this isn’t the only potential indictment on documents.

Of massive importance in this is that we now know that the “Bedminster Boxes” exist(ed). One possible tactic would be to leave out actually indicting on the Bedminster Boxes (which Smith did) until you see which SD Fla judge you get. Smith can then go to NJ if he wants, after he sees some initial Judge Cannon rulings and tests her “lessons learned” from the harsh 11th Circuit special master reversal.

For example, Smith could have included a lot of very-highly-classified stuff (as MTW’s post describes) because under CIPA there is an initial ex parte hearing (so I have read). Using this Smith can first gauge ex parte how Judge Cannon is acting. By including really, really shocking stuff, he can show Cannon the seriousness of the situation, while Smith can still withdraw particular counts (particular documents) to address public disclosure issues. Maybe even withdraw before Smith has to disclose the super-classified stuff to Trump, if Judge Cannon does something after the CIPA hearing that is like the out-of-bounds position on the special master.

And it’s possible that Smith withdrawing some documents from the SD Fla case after any adverse Judge Cannon ruling on disclosure would actually increase the public mystery around those documents. It only enhances the message that what Trump took was super secret. Again this will help with the DC press and any other appeals to CA11. Having to withdraw certain documents might also help with standing for government interlocutory appeals (that I don’t know enough about process on).

Another example, to take this to a logical conclusion: Smith can wait to see what public statements Trump makes after arraignment, and then likely seek some kind of limited gag and restricted viewing by Trump order, as Trump received in NYC. Having the super-classified documents in the initial case makes a gag-and-disclosure motion the hardest possible decision for Cannon, and at that stage redacted documents probably still work. If Cannon won’t issue an appropriate order, Smith can selectively drop what he wants. Indeed if he thinks he can bring charges in NJ, it’s not impossible that some of the Mar-Lago documents could be charged there too (like the “Milley war plan”).

Please read.  I an a conservative.  I disagree with you folks on nearly everything. Look at my post history!.
However
I apologize in advance for putting this imagery into your minds, but I really think you should consider this.
No matter what else you might think about Trump, we know how narcissistic and boastful he is.  I think that is undeniable.  Now imagine he gets elected and there is a strong attack on Israel.  And God uses America to rescue Israel.  And then imagine that Trump starts bragging that He is the Savior of Israel instead of giving God the glory.
That is how close we are to having a president with a messiah complex or another Nebuchadnezzar.
Oh, and also he would be able to say how much he has suffered and how much persecution he has been through.  What a suffering savior he has been.  Can you say, ""Antichrist""?  Pray hard people.
This isn't TDS.  If there has ever been _anything_ that liberals anc conservatives, gays and christians could agree on.  THIS IS IT.

Please read.  I an a conservative.  I disagree with you folks on nearly everything. Look at my post history!.
However
I apologize in advance for putting this imagery into your minds, but I really think you should consider this.
No matter what else you might think about Trump, we know how narcissistic and boastful he is.  I think that is undeniable.  Now imagine he gets elected and there is a strong attack on Israel.  And God uses America to rescue Israel.  And then imagine that Trump starts bragging that He is the Savior of Israel instead of giving God the glory.
That is how close we are to having a president with a messiah complex or another Nebuchadnezzar.
Oh, and also he would be able to say how much he has suffered and how much persecution he has been through.  What a suffering savior he has been.  Can you say, ""Antichrist""?  Pray hard people.

>Starting on Jan. 1, 2024, the state will reimburse child care providers at a rate 35% higher than they did this year — enabling them to significantly raise wages.

....

>The bill is the culmination of nearly a decade’s worth of advocacy from Let’s Grow Kids, a well-funded nonprofit that has led the charge on child care in Montpelier. But the cause was also strengthened by the Covid-19 pandemic, which underlined both the sector’s fragility and importance to the state economy, and a new Democratic supermajority in the House and Senate, which moved aggressively to enact several new expansions to the social safety net. 

....

>The bill will be funded in part by a new 0.44% payroll tax, which is why Scott objected to the legislation.

The section quoted below is just about the most clear and concise summary I've found of the Mueller report findings versus Durham's sham.   Gonna hold onto it for the next three dozen times someone says Trump was exonerated by the Mueller report while having never read a word of it. 

 
>“The only distinguishing thing between [Mueller's] investigation and yours is he refused to bring charges where he couldn't prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and you did,” Schiff said.

>Durham brought three charges forward, went to trial with two, and won convictions on zero—a point Democrats repeatedly brought up during the hearing.

>Mueller’s investigation concluded that there were “multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government.”

>“Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied way.”

>The Mueller investigation ultimately brought forward roughly three dozen charges and about a half-dozen convictions.

1210,jp0xsfh,t2_l24gn9uw,"The Mueller investigation turned over dozens of indictments and multiple convictions, not to mention actual evidence of wrongdoing. The Durham report? It's only *two* criminal cases ended in acquittal. Yet Conservatives remain wilfully ignorant on this issue, jumping to their conclusions and refusing to acknowledge that Durham couldnt find any evidence of ""The crime of the century"".

Durham's report was underwhelming to say the least. Four years the guy spent investigating this, and all he could come up with was some vague, non incriminating language. Durham's featured story on Fox News will say something different of course, but in the end, he couldn't find anything damning. So he appealed to conservatives with paragraphs of empty, opinionated rhetoric that will fuel partisan conspiracies and attitudes toward the FBI. Let's move on to what prompted all of this. 

The Steele Dossier has become the target of right wing outrage and ridicule, conservatives use it as the basis for their argument that the entire investigation was a ""hoax"". The Steele Dossier was not the impetus for the Russia investigation. Investigators, even Mueller himself did not rely on the dossier (or Hillary Clinton) to seek criminal charges, it had no influence on any significant findings. 

In fact, the investigation, which was eventually handed over to Mueller by the FBI, began well before our intelligence agencies were made privy to the Steele Dossier. The opening of the investigation was entirely warranted and relied on several things, the most significant concerning evidence that Russia hacked the DNC and stole emails, and also evidence of a Trump campaign advisor revealing that Russia had reached out to the campaign with an offer to release damaging information on Hillary Clinton. And that's not all. 

Let's start with the report that describes how when Trump found out about the Mueller probe for the first time he exclaimed *""This is the end of my presidency, I'm fucked""*. That's not how an innocent man responds to an investigation.

How about when Trump asked for Russia's help on national TV? 

*“I will tell you this, Russia: If you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,”*

Or how Trump cast doubt about Russian cyber attacks, contradicting our own intelligence agencies (and himself). During a press conference with Putin after meeting with him privately, Trump proclaimed in front of reporters, *""...President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today""*

*""I have president Putin, he just said it's not Russia... I will say this. I don't see any reason why it would be""*

Less than 24 hours later, Trump conveniently declared that he ""misspoke"", that he meant to say ""wouldn't"" instead of ""would"".

He even suggested Putin and Russia work with the U.S. on cyber security, have Russia join in on the special counsel that's investigating... Fucking RUSSIA!

Throughout Trump's presidency, he often aligned himself with Putin, defended and enabled him, repeated Kremlin talking points, and on several occasions, refused to confront Putin, chosing to blame America instead. America first my ass. Trump practically glorified Putin at any opportunity, and often at the expense of America and it's allies. 

Trump also sought to rescind or loosen Russian sanctions, and after becoming president in 2017, if it weren't for veto proof sanctions, he would have most likely ended them. 

Nonetheless, the Mueller investigation led to 37 indictments, multiple arrests, convictions and guilty pleas, and it was determined that there was a link between Russian officials and Trump campaign personnel, it was also determined that the president obstructed justice. 

Trump associates repeatedly lied to investigators about their Russian contacts and connections, while Trump dodged inquiries related to his efforts to influence testimony and impede proceedings. Trump associates George Papadopoulos, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen all admitted that they made false statements to federal investigators or to Congress.

Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager, and eventually found guilty of fraud, conspiracy, money laundering, tax evasion and the list goes on, gave Russian intelligence polling and campaign information. He also met with Russian nationals at Trump Tower, NY. Jared Kushner and Trump Jr joined him in that meeting after an intermediary informed the Trump campaign that they had damaging material on Hillary Clinton.

In the end, the Mueller report also found that Russia meddled and *""interfered in the election in systemic and sweeping fashion""* and to the benefit of the Trump campaign no less. 

If you're the type to indignantly claim ""nO cOlLuSIon!"", Understand that Mueller never sought to use the term ""collusion"", nor was it a crime he was investigating. He believed that ""collusion"" wasn't an appropriate crime to investigate under the conditions of charging or indicting a president, instead Mueller focused on criminal conspiracy law, and in the end, never came to anything nearly as conclusive as ""no collusion"". In fact, according to the Mueller report, the results of the investigation were unresolved and inconclusive

*""\[W\]hile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,""*

Mueller ***declined to exonerate Trump*** and detailed obstruction of justice charges against the president for his actions in attempting to undermine the investigation. In the end, Trump's obstruction was painfully clear, involving multiple efforts to jeopardize the investigation, curtail investigators, prevent evidence from being disclosed, coerce DOJ/admin officials, install loyal lackeys to oversee the probe, fire those who wouldn't compromise efforts, influence testimony and the list goes on.

However, indictment/further investigation didn't follow thanks to William Barr, his deranged theories on executive authority, and a DOJ policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president in the first place, how convenient. Mueller never cleared Trump of obstruction.

Any conclusion or mention of ""no collusion"" doesn't even appear in the Mueller report. ""NO COLLUSION"" is a phrase propagated by Trump, right wing media and conservative mouthpieces for the purpose of instilling it into the minds of Republicans who would go on to repeat it ad nauseum, and guess what, IT WORKED.

***Adding to it all, In 2020, a Republican controlled senate panel released a nearly 1,000 page report detailing Russia's interference in the 2016 election in favor of a Trump presidency, an extensive web of contacts between the Trump campaign and Kremlin officials, an eagerness from Trump officials to accept Russian assistance, and inexperienced, unqualified Trump campaign officials and advisers that *“presented attractive targets for foreign influence, creating notable counterintelligence vulnerabilities.”*, among other things of course.***

When it comes to this radically polarizing issue, it's nowhere near as simple as ""no collusion"" or a ""leftist hoax"", and it was without a doubt, justified. Findings have been made clear, efforts weren't steeped in some conspiracy, there was no ""witch hunt"", and the FBI was entirely warranted in opening it's probe. All while Trump's continued attempts to thwart and obstruct justice remain evident.",/r/politics/comments/14fj0lj/adam_schiff_gets_john_durham_to_admit_russia/jp0xsfh/,"Thursday, June 22, 2023, at 07:21:01 AM",1,r/politics
